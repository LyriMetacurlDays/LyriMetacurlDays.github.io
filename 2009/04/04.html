        <p class="writing">Weather: Sunny&#33;<br><br>Went to bed about 01:00.<br><br>Breakfast.<br><br>Decided to go home <q>Tomorrow Not Today</q>. This decision ended up making today much better than it would otherwise have been.<br><br>Some computer and TV.<br><br>Dinner – same as yesterday, except the bacon was a smoky piece and a normal piece, and also beans were added&#33; By the way, the egg is poached whenever I have bacon and egg (at least for all my life till now and probably a very long time after that also).<br><br>Some TV and computer. Nothing to do on computer except listen to today's music theme.<br><br>Smelled the tulips outside. At the time, I thought they were poppies.<br><br>Watched the Grand National (horse race) and had Tea (fish pie).<br><br>Watched (the last in the current series of) TV Burp. The fight this time was Bowl Headed Girl vs Cushion Headed Boy. The Bowl Headed Girl won.<br><br>Also watched ‘Primeval’ episode, with the gremlin.<br><br>Bath.<br><br>Watched ‘NCIS’ and ‘CSI New York’ while having supper (babybel and ham butties with crisps).<br><br>Little YouTube and some TV&#58; ‘An Inconvenient Truth’.<br><br>Bed about 03&#58;00 tomorrow (strangely late).</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today was at the Space Ship all day. Also, today's goodness rating was a 95, considering not much bad stuff happened, although I didn't feel really good. Though it got the same rating as ‘Directive Dump’, as a tie-breaker I decided that today was the better one of the two (those ended up being the top two most positive days of 2009).</p>
