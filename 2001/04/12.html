        <p class="writing">It was some random day which I think was around April 2001, so the real day could be a bit off. Anyway, today I was happily playing in the garden in the Nest, in Overheaven, as an innocent child, and I picked up a stick. On the stick was a spider. It was medium sized - about half a centimetre wide for its body and legs about 2 centimetres long. But something about it gave me the chills down my spine.<br><br>It was crawling slowly and creepily towards my hand. It seemed extremely confident and kind of angry. It kept raising its legs like a warning that it's about to attack as it walked, slowly but purposefully, taking its time.<br><br>Looking closely at it, it looked very black with a white skull-and-crossbones sort of pattern on it. Like a pirate flag. It slowly, menacingly and creepily kept crawling towards my hand. When it was close, I swapped hands on the stick. It noticed, and purposefully turned around to creepily crawl towards my other hand. I swapped again, and again it turned around, pursuing the hand that was holding the stick. This really started to creep me out after a few times. This spider was out to get me!<br><br>The Overgod came out, and I told him about the creepy spider. He gave it a go too. He held the stick and the spider started to pursue his hand too, slowly, purposefully, deliberately, wherever it was. The Overgod got worried about it too. I went back inside. The Overgod said later he had released it in a deeper part of the garden.<br><br>That was it for today. However, this was not the end of the story of Creepy 1. The rest of its story goes like this. Apparently a few days later, a dead bird was found below the creepy spider's web, and the creepy spider was confidently standing there, as if it had killed the bird. The Overgod took the spider into the kitchen and burned it, and it aggresively attacked the flame, attempting to bite it, then met its demise. Later, baby Creepy 1s were cropping up under the caravan, and the Overgod killed them all. Later he regretted it, though, saying he wonders if it was a rare species. It was likely harmless, after all.<br><br>It is my own hunch that it may have been a different species of spider, but I somehow doubt that this was the last family of Creepy 1. I have the feeling that there are still Creepy 1s lurking out in the world. There are plenty of spiders I've only ever seen one of ever, and they're not likely to be one-off chances. For example the garden in the Nest is a very small part of the world, and I have seen a mysterious matt-turquoise-bodied spider (with brown legs) there in the 1990s - it used to be a regular visitor. I've only ever seen one of those too, and I've never seen any entomological documentation on it either (and I have looked).<br><br>New update: Over twenty years later, there was a new piece of information from the Overgod, which is that he suspects it might have been a melanistic garden spider, because apparently melanistic spiders are more aggressive.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Creepy 1 is the name I gave to this spider, because there were some we named later (although not recorded), such as Creepy 2, which was like a fast version but not scary, and Creepy 3, which was just a seven-legged <q>normal spider</q> that seemed to walk slowly because it was wounded, and the closest one to being a Creepy 1 was the <q>Homing Spider</q> in July 2018 (see the entry among the Related Days section below).</p>
