        <p>Date: 22nd <a href="../02.html"><u>February 2022</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r91 nc">&nbsp;91&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>

        <p class="writing">I and the Emperor went for what is probably our latest walk ever (at the Hill). We were back after 1am.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>Weather: Sunny, but windy (and cold but hot for February).<br><br>I and the Overgod visited the Space Ship, to see the Yeoman. We had tea (drink), watched some TV and videos, and had egg on toast.<br><br>We couldn't go on a walk with Clasher, so we went to Rainford Walk 1 instead.<br><br>We went to the Normal Walk (first half) also.<br><br>I did some updates and stuff. I skipped visiting the pub, due to the upcoming commitments today.<br><br>Thompson messaged, in a reply from 23rd January 2021, no longer on Ignore - that's his first contact since the year 2000, I presume.<br><br>That evening, I visited Corimanda for the errand number 2.2. On the way there and back, I was listening to today's theme song and also &lsquo;Anything Can Happen&rsquo; (Was Not Was).<br><br>I took a screenshot at the exact second when it was 22:22:22 on 2/2/22.<br><br>We watched a film.<br><br>The Emperor came. We went for a walk (also with the Overgod) at the Hill.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today achieved the Representative (red), Most Legendary (gold) and Best Day of the Year (green) so far. Quite a rare achievement. I partly hoped that it would retain its status, but also didn't mind if not because that would mean there are better days in 2022.<br><br>Shazam'd song: &lsquo;Get Up and Boogie&rsquo; (Silver Convention).</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Number coincidences not mentioned above</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>It was a Tuesday (which is the 2nd day of the week and also sounds like <q>2s day</q>. There were four walks (two times two altogether). Today won two star prizes in the end (red and gold). Two of the related days end in a &lsquo;2&rsquo; (&lsquo;Squashed a Week Into a Day 2&rsquo; and &lsquo;Whatever I Want 2&rsquo;).</p>
