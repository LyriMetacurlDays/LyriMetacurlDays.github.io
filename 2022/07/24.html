        <p class="writing">Sleep (at the May 2022 AirBnB Room 5).<br><br>Cups of tea (instead of breakfast). No cereal.<br><br>Some DOOM Eternal.<br><br>11:30 - A sudden shift was announced, to move to the October 2021 AirBnB at 12:00. Packed up everything again. Dual-wielded rucksacks (carrying both batches from yesterday at the same time). Went to an Uber the Host had ordered. The couple I saw last night was there too. We all went to the October 2021 AirBnB (I had room 2 again like last time).<br><br>We had some beers that the Host had brought (Stella and Buddweiser), and they also ordered a good shawarma meal takeaway for everyone (with some contribution). They had to get an Uber to pick it up because they don't have a car. We had that, while I put music on YouTube (mostly the October 2021 playlist, but with a few extras).<br><br>I played a bit more DOOM Eternal afterwards, then went to Sainsbury's. It had bad reviews and said everything was over priced compared to the price tags. I got a few things (cereal, PG Tips box, Quorn cocktail sausages, and a Madeira cake (to celebrate my accomplishment, of course&#33). I think the real price was nine pounds something but for some reason I though it said nineteen pounds something, and I was not questioning it in the moment because my mind wasn't focused on the moment. They didn't give a receipt (or even offer one). So perhaps I got ripped off&#33;<br><br>Back at the October 2021 AirBnB, which had changed since they had moved a lot of stuff to the July 2022 AirBnB. I noticed that the carpet was an eight-colour repeating curved rainbow (pink, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, blue, purple) (so it's not gay).<br><br>I had some tea (the drink). I then spend lots of time trying to think of (and then work out) today's title, instead of going on more DOOM Eternal. I knew it was an anagram of SONIC but thought it had the C, O and N at the start and didn't begin with an S, so it should have started with IS, but then all the viable combinations (sounding okay and not sounding like SONIC) seemed like a Boolean variable name (ISCON and ISNOC). They didn't feel right. I also looked up what actual words can be made from it, and apparently only ICONS is possible, as well as that being one of the second-closest types of combinations, so, after much deliberation, I settled on that. Not sure if I can relate it in some way to icons (either desktop ones or worshipped ones).</p>
