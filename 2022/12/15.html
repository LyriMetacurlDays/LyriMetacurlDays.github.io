        <h1>The Spacibo Effect</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 15th <a href="../12.html"><u>December 2022</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r94 nc">&nbsp;94&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Music theme: Skies Forever Blue (Luxury Elite).<br>

        <p class="writing note">Note: The video version (above) seems to have the strange property of being the only video I know of that always auto-activates CCs (subtitles), so if it does that to you, you can switch them off (or not). I thought it was something Toby must have programmed into it, similar to how Tom Scott can somehow program his YouTube video title to display the number of views.</p>

        <p class="writing note">Quote of the Day: <q>Everyone is under a trance.</q> &mdash; Me.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>There was some ambient background noise all day which sounded like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7TrNwXAo9k">the Deltarune bunker</a>.<br><br>I started off having no food or drinks for the first half of the day.<br><br>At some point, I had a great feeling, like enhanced senses.<br><br>Laughing and listening to lots of music, while nobody else was in Hgwrtz.<br><br>There was also a theme of <q>insecurity</q>, but like I was observing myself in an objective light, like a parent (or extremely strong <q>observing ego</q>) as well as emotional sensitivity.<br><br>Dinner was crumpets and fried egg.<br><br>Later in the day, when the Overgod and the Overgoddess were back, we went to see X &#198; A-13, Maiar and the Viscountess. Apparently, X &#198; A-13 was shy at first (as I had heard, she gets shy if there are lots of people, but she has never been shy of me personally as far as I know).<br><br>We went to Lidl afterwards and got some oat milk and salad.<br><br>The Overgod made some stew.<br><br>I went to the pub for the quiz (Quizee Rascals team, including Ralsie, Rhea, MEgan, Andras, Sturas and Dave Biscuit). They all had Christmas shirts on, and I promised to come next week with mine on, and they said they'd be there too, but we also heard that the quiz will not be on till mid-January or thereabouts.<br><br>I left back to Hgwrtz after the quiz, to see the Emperor. He wasn't there at first, but he turned up. We went for a walk at the hill, with the Overgod. There was a slightly crescent half-moon and not many asteroids (that was yesterday's thing).</p>
