        <p class="writing">I had to get up at the same kind of time as for “Work” today - about 6am.<br><br>I took the bus to the train station early on, by about 07:20.<br><br>I bought a Monster Energy Ultimate (sugar free and aspartame free), for a caffeine boost.<br><br>As planned via the mission document, I took the free route to Huddersfield. This involved first getting the train to Dewsbury, then switching to the bus for the rest of the way. There wasn't much waiting in the stations on the way. However, I got to Huddersfield station within plenty of time, and bought a Gregg (a.k.a. a chicken bake from Greggs).<br><br>I also contacted the Queen of Light, although I don't think she could make it to the social occasion today.<br><br>At Huddersfield, I walked to the Triple N house, which was in a very arbitrary location. As I was walking, I whistled ‘Greensleeves’ and ‘Ave Maria’ - which, come to think of it, are also commonly used default tunes for keyboards.<br><br>When I got to the Triple N house, the door was ajar. I went inside, and it seemed like an empty house, except for three creepy people sitting in a small room. A mother, a father and a son. They seemed somewhat disturbed by my presence, and that they were looking at me like zombies, so I didn't look at them much, and instead calmly walked by and up the stairs, thinking that maybe the appointment would be there. Nothing was on the next level, so I went up yet another flight of stairs. I noticed that this flight of stairs was conspicuously different - made of glass, rather than normal (carpeted, wooden) stairs that the first flight had been.<br><br>At the very top of these stairs was a sharp, spiky metal logo that said “ND”, hanging over an official looking desk. But, there was nobody in it. To the right was a door which said “vacant” (in other words, “it had a vacant expression”). To the left, was another ajar door.<br><br>The room on the left seemed very well-kept, but strangely unused. It was a rooftop room (so it had a slanted ceiling) There was a small office inside, but that just had some old cleaning utensils inside. At the far end of the room was a small cubby hole; perhaps a little door for plumbers or electricians to access.  Definitely not big enough to fit inside.<br><br>I went back to the ND desk and sat in it, authoritatively. I heard some people talking downstairs, mentioning that “somebody had gone upstairs”, so I got out of the ND desk and began walking downstairs, pretending that I hadn't done anything.<br><br>I met the person I was supposed to meet there. He introduced me to the real waiting room (not the creepy non-waiting room I had walked past earlier, where that family was still sitting). I sat just out of their view, in the real waiting room.<br><br>A few minutes later, after that family had gone, I was called in. I was asked a few questions, and it only lasted five minutes. Then, I was sent back home. The Internet said that the bus would leave at 10:35, but when I got to the bus station, it said the real time they leave would be 10:29. Lucky I got there early!<br><br>Interestingly, both bus routes now leave at the same time (probably under the new timetable) and both reach Leeds at the same time!<br><br>I went to the front of the upper deck in the bus, sitting on the right side (Seat 3). There was an old man in Seat 2. Oddly, the old man moved to the middle of the deck, seemingly to avoid me (or to spread out).<br><br>I always prefer Seat 2 (because it's also known as the “King of Awesome Seat”), so I happily moved into it. I wonder what the old man thought when he saw that. Who cares.<br><br>The bus took a very convoluted route, but the driver must have done it about a thousand times, I assume. I thought about how bus driving seems like an art.<br><br>About half way through, the bus stopped and everyone was told to get off. We all went onto the other bus on the same route, including the driver. However, there was a bit of a seat shift now. Suddenly sitting at the front of the top deck had become a lot more popular.<br><br>Some other guy had taken Seat 1 and hogged Seat 2 with his bag, and Seats 3 and 4 were also taken by an old couple (unrelated to the grumpy old man from earlier). The third row (seats 10 to 12) were also full. So the best I could do was to make do with seat 6 (and hogged Seat 5 with my own bag).<br><br>I listened to some music and wondered if I could get off the bus if it passes close to the train station at Leeds. I also contacted Head0nShoe to see if he would come out to today's social. It seemed like he would.<br><br>Eventually, more than an hour's travel later (and with the seat hoggers still in place) it was approaching that time. The bus did pass very close to the train station, so I got off there. This was at approximately midday. I navigated my way to Park Square.<br><br>For about 45 minutes, I hung around in Park Square, waiting for Head0nShoe. However, he stayed asleep, and it became time to meet up with Kilo, as planned.<br><br>I walked to ‘Thai a Roy Dee’ and met Kilo there. Zita arrived later on. We had a great dinner there. I deliberately chose the same kind of meal as I had during ‘The Analysis of Consciousness’ (see related days, below). However, today's version was much better, since it was a restaurant meal, rather than a ready-meal from a shop.<br><br>We planned to go to the market afterwards, but discovered that it was closed. So we went to the Everyman Cinema and watched the comedy film ‘The Death of Stalin’.<br><br>We went to the Brewery Tap after this, and had some beer and sweet potato chips, with onion rings, as well as some great conversation.<br><br>After that, we went to Bundobust for a final beer. Then we all went home after that. I and Zita had cups of tea and had a walk in Beckett's Park, to look at the stars. I explained to him how to find the Andromeda Galaxy (Find Cassiopeia's second V, which points to Mirak (which is also part of Pegasus), then look further towards Cassiopeia to see Mu Andromedae, a little further to see Nu Andromedae, and then M31 should be right next to that - however, it was obviously too faint to see tonight).<br><br>Also, at some point, a spider seemed to have flown onto my wrist in the dark, and caused an itch, so when I tried to place my hand on it to find out what it was, I felt a weird tiny fluffy creature, got scared and threw it off, hopefully before it could bite me. If it was Australia, I could have died!<br><br>Back home, I noticed that Zita also seemed to really hate today's theme music. Perhaps he thought it was cheesy. So I just listened to it by myself.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Note</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* I think today's theme is not as good as the theme of ‘The Analysis of Consciousness’ (see related days, below), but today's happiness rating was 5 points better (which is a hell of a lot, considering it was in the mid-90s range). I presume today was better mostly because I actually had friends today. An additional perk was that I had been the one who created today's social event, rather than just attending something. So now I was bringing joy to other people's lives.</p>
