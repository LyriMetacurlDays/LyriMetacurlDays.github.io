    <p class="writing note">Note: Today's theme is a rare type - Fairy Glass - exactly by definition because it is <q>excited</q> (primary Fairy) and <q>bitty</q> (secondary Glass) - and, by the way, it sounds like it is going deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole until it glitches because it couldn't get any deeper.</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>I got up at 10:30.<br><br>I made coffees and updated stuff.<br><br>The pay slip came (this time with the increased wage correct, although it was quite a bit less than I had been told; £10.71 instead of £13 per hour). Also, the DVD of &lsquo;The Thing&rsquo; (2011) arrived.<br><br>I continued to write up more entries from September 2011.<br><br>I watched as the original plans for today <q>turned into dust</q> (as in the song by Mazzy Star) and all that was left was a visit to the Viscount.<br><br>I had toast (using the last of my bread supply and the out-of-date salmon Philadelphia cheese).<br><br>I got a Tariq's curry and went to the Viscount's place. We watched the first episode of &lsquo;A Series of Unfortunate Events&rsquo; (new TV series version) and Episode 1 of the Japanese version of &lsquo;Attack on Titan&rsquo;. We had two cans of Kronenbourg (1664) during this time. We shared some music tracks. His included some &lsquo;Kings of Leon&rsquo; tracks and mine included &lsquo;4.5 Billion Years&rsquo; (Windpearl), which the Viscount liked too.</p>
