        <h1>An Overperfect Day</h1>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>Rating: <span class="r110 nc">&nbsp;110&nbsp;</span> (Fabulous).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p class="writing">Quote of the Day&#58; <q>His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world, "this was a man!"</q> &mdash; William Shakespeare.</p>

        <p><br>Subtheme: Close To Me (The Cure).<br>

        <p class="writing"><br>I was out with the Queen of Awesome and Tarquin. We went back down Briggate to a night club. After some dancing and drinks (for an hour or two), Tarquin got left behind and I and the Queen of Awesome went to Sela Bar for a last pint of the night.<br><br>We took a taxi to 8th Headquarters. I got the Jack Daniels special bottles out. I had a bit of the Jack Daniels White Rabbit and the Queen of Awesome drank some of the Jack Daniels Honey Liqueur straight from the bottle.<br><br>We listened to some music. The Queen of Awesome said that my speakers weren't good enough and needed more bass.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Part 2</u></h3>
        <p><br>Subtheme: Pictures Of You (The Cure).<br>

        <p class="writing"><br>It got light and I woke up in a very blissful environment in 8th Headquarters with the Queen of Awesome asleep next to me. This was not a dream.<br><br>I made coffee and did the arm workouts. The Queen of Awesome woke up, but she wanted to stay in bed.<br><br>I made dinner - Big Soup and “hangover cure” toasts (marmite, pepper and coriander). The music list I had on at the time was these four (on repeat all):-</p>
        <p><br>Pegasi (Miguel Puente).
        <br><br>Acamar (Frankey and Sandrino).
        <br><br>4.5 Billion Years (Windpearl).
        <br><br>All Things to All Men (Instrumental) (The Cinematic Orchestra).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>The Queen of Awesome wanted a normal sleep, so she rested sideways on the bed, curled up. I rested next to her for a few more hours. The window was open and light was shining in through the blinds. There was a lot of bliss, and it felt like a timeless moment, that lasted for a couple of hours in real life, but it could have lasted forever, and it was extremely sentimental because I knew it would end.<br><br>In this moment, I had far exceeded all my expectations for how good life can possibly be. Everything was more than perfect. I wasn't just the best person in the world at this time - I was far beyond that.<br><br>Few if any combinations of reality could possibly be better, I thought. I seriously doubted that I'd ever be this content ever again in my life, but I will always be open to the possibility.<br><br>Part of the reason why this was an amazing time was because of my supposedly unrealistic expectations being exceeded, and everyone constantly telling me this could not and would not happen - all their put-downs now having been being freshly smashed, because it had all come true!<br><br>When the timeless moment came to an end, I gave the Queen of Awesome the box of gifts which I had been saving for her (including the ‘Queen of Awesome’ flask).<br><br>I played her the song ‘Nantucket Sleighride’ (Mountain) and she liked that.

        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Part 3</u></h3>
        <p><br>Subtheme: Why Does It Always Rain On Me? (Travis).<br>

        <p class="writing"><br>We went out for food at about 17:00. First we went to the Arc. The Queen of Awesome thought it was like Leeds was a new city, as she had forgotten where lots of things are.<br><br>It was rainy and there was the distant rumble of thunder.<br><br>We decided to go to YO! Sushi (in the Trinity centre). We went the Burley Road way, and on the way it rained really heavily, and we didn't get umbrellas out in time, so we got really soaked. The Queen of Awesome gave the gifts to me to mind during the walk, so they wouldn't get wet, and disposed of the box (which had been soaked through).<br><br>The sun and rainbow came out later and we began to dry off quite quickly.<br><br>There were some big puddles and some cars would sometimes splash people. The splashes all missed me, but the Queen of Awesome was partly hit by one.<br><br>In the Trinity Centre, The Queen of Awesome said it seems a lot smaller than she remembered. I compared it to the Eaton Center in Toronto.<br><br>We went to the train station afterwards. The Queen of Awesome did some shopping there and then caught the train to Bradford. I realised that I still had the gifts in my bag, but I could give her them tomorrow.<br><br>I walked back to 8th Headquarters and it rained really heavily again, but this time I used my umbrella. I went the Bell Vue Road way back. On the way, I was still quite shocked (physically and emotionally) about the extreme level of success that had happened today.<br><br>Outside 8th Headquarters, I decided to take the bins in, but the gate kept perfectly auto-closing every time (being overperfect), so I had to open the gate again every time I wanted to take the next bin out.<br><br>I went inside and wrote about today, then it was 22:30 and I really missed the day and the bliss. Today had been better than perfect, and breached my concept of perfection, so I had to give it a rating over 100. I gave it a 110. This was the first day to ever achieve overperfection. It meant that now ‘The Dark Side’ was second-best.<br><br>I decided to go to sleep then, so I couldn't be sad about the ending today. Similar to how I decided to end ‘The Dark Side’ early to preserve the rating.</p>
