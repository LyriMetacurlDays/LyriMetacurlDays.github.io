        <p class="writing">Weather: Frosty.<br><br>Today, everything conspired to make us late getting to Brimham Rocks.<br><br>We were all asleep until about 11:40 (which was extra late).<br><br>I got up, with the Overgod and the Countess. We had coffee and tea.<br><br>The Overgod had lost his driving glasses last night while walking home drunk. He checked up the entire road. Meanwhile, the Countess showed me two new songs (see today's two subthemes, above).<br><br>We went towards the Fenton. We checked for the glasses while driving up the road.<br><br>The Fenton was closed. I was told I was walking at a snail's pace when I got back to the car.<br><br>We went to the Viscount's place. He took ages to get ready.<br><br>We drove to the pharmacy on Woodsley Road. The Overgod bought some new driving glasses, which he said were really good.<br><br>I did navigation to Brimham Rocks. We got stuck in Otley, then had to take a massive zigzag west to Ilkley first, and along an awkward long bridge (with two way traffic but only room for one vehicle), then east, then finally got back on track.<br><br>At Darcy Banks, the Viscount walked at a snail's pace to get to the pop shop (and back).<br><br>At Brimham Rocks: It was supposed to be sunny, but wasn't. We went round the rocks anyway.<br><br>The Viscount coincidentally mentioned the TV show &lsquo;The Man in the High Castle&rsquo;, just one day after I had first heard of it.<br><br>After the trip, the Overgod dropped the Viscount off at his place, then dropped me off at my place. The others went back home.<br><br>I made my first NutriBullet smoothie. I call it the Gorgeous Smoothie. I thought it would be savoury, but it turned out mildly sweet. Recipe:-</p>
        <p class="writing note">Put in the “tall cup”:-<br>-Four or five fresh basil leaves<br>-80g raw bean mix (lentil, chick pea, adzuki bean, mung bean and black eyed bean). (Which I had bought from the co-op earlier).<br>-An entire avodaco seed (cut to pieces).<br>-A satsuma (peeled).<br>-5 olives stuffed with pimiento (the kind you get in a jar).<br>-Diced sweet potato to the top.<br>-Add the water, and some macadamia nuts.<br>Blend it.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Today was meant to be Queen-of-Awesome-free, but, nevertheless, the Queen of Awesome contacted me at the end of the day, and had an argument.<br><br>I went to the New Office at 9PM, but didn't manage to watch &lsquo;Doctor Who&rsquo; before midnight. Too many distractions.</p>
