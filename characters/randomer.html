<p>Someone who was stated to exist. However, it is currently unknown if this person exists or if they are Uwu.</p>
<p>This is also one of the cases of a stolen theme, which only occurs during a time when themes are being decided. The short list of those are here:-</p>
<p>* The Randomer stole the theme that was originally Uwu's (but a much more suitable one was given to Uwu).</p>
<p>* Marion stole the theme that was originally Drourem's (interestingly, Marion was introduced on the exact same month that Drourem was born, but this is entirely coincidental).</p>
<p>* FC stole the theme that was originally Avada Kedavra's (so more appropriate themes could be given to them).</p>
<p>* Aaa stole the theme that was originally Walshy's (but a much more suitable one was given to Walshy).</p>
<p>* Solar Soul Awesome stole the theme that was originally the Princess's (but a much more suitable one was given to the Princess).</p>
<p>* Lyri stole the theme that was originally Trish's (then Trish got given the other substitute, which is widely considered better by most).</p>
