        <p class="writing note">Note: There wasn't a theme originally, so I later decided to give this really annoying theme song which is the theme song of the Downstairs Housemate of 2018.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>This day just completely fizzled away, as if time was skipping to the next good part of my life. I went to Work as usual, although stayed late. Good, because it means I can leave early tomorrow.<br><br>It's interesting to note that I changed my diet again, this time to attempt to include higher fibre. It's amazing how little fibre is in most things. For example, carrots and mushrooms both have a mere 2.8% fibre. So I would need to have over a kilogram of either to have sufficient fibre. I heard pickled plums are high in fibre, but couldn't find any. Apparently raspberries are the best, but apparently too expensive. Blueberries are good but the worst for pesticide.<br><br>The general ranking list of starch-free fibre I could find in today's research, and how much I would apparently need to eat in one day, was:-</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Raspberry - 7% (450 grams).</li>
        <li>Avocado - 6.2% (510 grams).</li>
        <li>Pumpkin seeds - 6% (530 grams).</li>
        <li>Blackberry - 5% (640 grams).</li>
        <li>Pickled red cabbage - 3.5% (900 grams).</li>
        <li>Carrot or mushroom - 2.8% (1.1 kg).</li>
        <li>Broccoli - 2.7% (1.2 kg).</li>
        <li>Blueberry - 2.4% (1.3kg).</li>
        <li>Leafy salad - 2.1% (1.5 kg).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="writing"><br>In comparison, allowing for starch, Bitesize Shredded Wheat was the best at 13% (250 grams).<br><br>Okay, at the end of the day, some drama actually did happen. I got called by the Landladi, accused of wandering around the house “naked”. Here in Britain, being bare chested for a second is usually called “naked”, but, to the Landladi, “naked” means the Full Monty. She threatened to kick me out if she believes the housemates again. But, what if she asks them again and they remember the time before the accusation, when I had a bare chest? Then, I will get kicked out. I was already pissed off today from a load of shite that had happened, so I had to really contain my anger, but it was intolerable because I cannot afford to have cortisol in my blood, destroying my chances of success at everything.<br><br>Today became rated 47, the new most pathetic day of 2018 by far and away (the second most pathetic was only 1 week ago though). When it gets this bad, I tend to naturally avoid good things. Because, who knows, they might cheer me up.<br><br>I am self-aware that I am self-aware about all this.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Memo</u></h3>
		<p class="writing note"><br>* As you may have noticed, today I have suddenly changed the term “worst” in terms of days to be “most pathetic” because that's what it is. The “patheticness rating” is worked out by the equation of: patheticness = 100 - rating. So, ironically, that means only 5 days since records began have actually had zero or subzero patheticness. Today's patheticness was 53, which is pretty high for this nanoperiod (new word meaning a subset of a nanoera&semi; the current nanoera is the Violezoic (named after Violence, the seventh circle of Hell) and the current nanoperiod, which corresponds to about a month, is the Early Violezoic).</p>
