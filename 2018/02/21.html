        <div class="regular-content">
        <p class="writing note">Used to say “Quote at the start but not above the theme but there is no theme so it's at the top anyway” but now there is a theme so it's not at the top: “I'm going to be a total powerhouse. I'm going to be one of those people who do most of the work.” - Me, aspiring to be conscientious. “One of those people who do most of the work” is based on a video I saw recently.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Walked and took the Shuttle Bus to Work. On the walking part, I noticed that walking at a normal speed is actually quicker than taking the Regular Bus. It left three minutes after I did, and I caught up to it near the destination by regular walking.<br><br>A measure of how viable it is to catch a bus (if time is the only factor) is “how long it would be worth waiting for the bus before it becomes so much waiting that it would take less time to walk there”. In this case, that length of time is negative three minutes (since it is below zero minutes, it always takes longer to catch the bus).<br><br>I had switched from my regular coffees to having a free quadruple espresso (from the free coffee machines). After all, it is free.<br><br>Some stuff was sorted. The Technical Problem was not solved, but it seemed to be more well understood, not just experienced by myself, and to have also ticked off one of the staff who was testing my emails (so hopefully they will be able to do something about it tomorrow).<br><br>I thought about ‘Good Better Best Fabulous Fizz’ and decided that those can be general categories of ratings. I also then had to think what the opposite of that is, and, in doing so, invent a definition for negative ratings (something I had not taken seriously before). I decided that a negative rating (below 0) would be for when the person becomes malicious and consciously causes harm to self and/or others (that is below 0 because it is unrealistically bad, similar to how overperfection is unrealistically good) (unrealistic models of reality can cause feelings that go beyond the realistic 0 to 100 range).<br><br>So anyway, I decided the opposite phrase would be ‘Bad Worse Worst Malicious Murk’. The last category name had to meet a lot of criteria to match ‘Fizz’, for example, it had to start with an ‘M’, be one syllable, be a sort of word that triggers a reaction like ‘is it really that extreme?’, and not be associated with much other stuff (like Mist, Matt or Muck, which also came close as candidates). So the new rating categories are:-<br><br>
        Murk: -15 or less.<br>
        Malicious: -14 to -1.<br>
        Worst: 0 to 14.<br>
        Worse: 15 to 28.<br>
        Bad: 29 to 42.<br>
        Medium: 43 to 57.<br>
        Good: 58 to 71.<br>
        Better: 72 to 85.<br>
        Best: 86 to 100.<br>
        Fabulous: 101 to 114.<br>
        Fizz: 115 or more.<br>
        <br>So far, I have not invented any categories beyond the two extremes (Murk and Fizz) since even Malicious and Fabulous are extremely rare (in my life I have so far had zero Malicious days and only two Fabulous days).<br><br>Went home (to 10th Headquarters) by Shuttle Bus and walking.<br><br>My Work Headphones arrived, also.<br><br>I and the Emperor played some ‘Dawn of the Tiberium Age’ (it worked this time). The Emperor really liked it. He played as the Allies, and I was allied to him but playing as the Soviets (so together we were the ‘Oldies’), and we were both against GDI and Nod (the ‘Newies’), who were AIs but they were also against each other. We did a desert version (which we eventually won) and a snow one (which had a game crash). Next time, we will play ‘Goodies vs Baddies’ (or vice versa).<br><br>I watched a great video at the end of the day.</p>
