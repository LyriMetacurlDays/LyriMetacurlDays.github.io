        <p class="writing note">Note: Today was in many ways the opposite of yesterday. It was less happy, I stayed up way too much (rather than resting) and yesterday was down-to-earth, while today was probably half delirium and half fantasy. Also, I did not publish this day on version 2 of the blog until nearly nine months after it happened, in case one or two of my three known readers got concerned (I would have said “currently known readers” but most of my entries still said 1 or 0 views, so I knew there were likely only three readers at this time, because I knew three people who read it).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>I stayed up till about 5am or something. During this time, the Queen of Caffeine introduced me to this song (above) and it was established that the music theme would be it. In this case, currently, all versions of the above are valid and therefore currently don't count as different versions in this diary.<br><br>I had a dream of a different accommodation, which I figured must be the Diverse version of 10th Headquarters, and family visitors were visiting (probably the Overgod, the Countess, the Emperor, the Princess and the Viscount). The dream was total chaos, which could be a message about not staying up so long because it will cause chaos and delirium.<br><br>I woke up at 8am, and, unlike most days, I didn't need a drink of water (because I had had enough before going to sleep - lukewarm water, which is far easier to drink than cold water).<br><br>I had a rest for a couple more hours and a conversation with Spiritual Mark on the phone, who said I should be doing the <q>Twelve Dimensional Shield Building Technique</q> twice a day.<br><br>I realised that I had to clarify which versions of ‘For an Angel’ (Paul van Dyk) were the correct ones for the 20th and 21st of April 2013, because, weirdly, the ones on YouTube that said in the title that they were the ‘2009’ version also said they were the ‘Angel in Heaven’ version in the automatic analysis, while the ones that said in the title that they were the ‘Angel in Heaven’ version said they were the ‘2009’ version in the automatic analysis. I checked on Spotify and that agreed with the final decision I made for which ones are which (which is that the titles are correct in this instance). It is also a strange coincidence that of all the versions, those two were singled out (as they are the only versions that became themes so far). Check those days' entries out, they are epic.<br><br>I and the Emperor tried to play ‘Dawn of the Tiberium Age’ as the Baddies again, which took approximately 9 hours (13:30 to 22:30) and didn't accomplish anything other than errors. But there were some good visual effects. We managed to defeat the Allies near the end, but it kept throwing error after error and corrupting the saved data, so we kept starting again.<br><br>During the dinner break, my clothes snagged on one of the cupboard doors and it got ripped clean off (the cubpoard door, that is). I tried to put it back on but realised that it was a very heavy door connected to some flimsy chipboard with some short screws, so it was a complete wonder that it had even managed to stay on at all (the same for all the other cupboard doors, which might just fall off at any time).<br><br>In the last bit of the day, I managed to watch a couple of short catchup videos for work and get to bed.<br><br></p>
