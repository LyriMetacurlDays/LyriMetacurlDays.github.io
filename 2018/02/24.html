        <h1>Downtime</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 24th <a href="../02.html"><u>February 2018</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r93 nc">&nbsp;93&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Music theme: Balla Da-Li (Awesome version) (Boom Boxx feat. Linda O.).<br>

        <p><br>Subtheme: Dawn of the Tiberium Age Menu Music (derived from Frank Klepacki).<br>

        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today's title had not been used yet, so I thought I might as well use it. Also, today's music theme had not been used yet either, even though it was the older “Getting a Job” music (the newer one being ‘Yes’ (LMFAO) (I heard that it actually came out first too, in 2005 apparently, while ‘Yes’ came out in 2009). Anyway, so it was that February 2018 ended up hogging both of the overpositive “Getting a Job” music themes, and for good reason.</p>

        <p class="writing">There was some downtime / resting at first, then some work.<br><br>I went to town and bought a new mattress, because it was discovered that the Landladi had bought a new mattress before I moved in but that one of the other housemates had stolen it and replaced it with the old, lumpy, mouldy one that I had had for the past two weeks. I hate whoever did that. Oh well, this mattress is a super deluxe memory foam one so I probably ended up with a far better mattress than I would have if this had not happened.<br><br>As there was a sudden lack of Quadruple Espressos, I felt a strange headache that got more and more intense. That is, until I realised what it was and made a round of coffees (I started a new packet of coffee, this time “Rare Ethiopia Blossom” (though it had no indication of what the strength was so I put 1.5 times the usual amount in). The headache was no more.<br><br>There was another round of ‘Baddies vs Goodies’ in ‘Dawn of the Tiberium Age’. The Goodies (GDI and Allies) beat me (Soviet) and the Emperor (Nod) many times on some temperate maps (the settings seemed different, for example Volkov was not a hero but merely acted as a normal commando), and it seemed production speed was very slow while the enemy AI (who was set on Hard but not Extreme) had a very fast production rate.<br><br>After this, we did a desert mission of ‘Oldies vs Newies’ and set the enemy AI to Hard and Extreme, but with the catch that the Newies (GDI and Nod) were set against each other. The Oldies (Allies and Soviet) then used ‘steamroller’ tactics to defeat the Newies. This was our most successful and memorable game in ‘Dawn of the Tiberium Age’.<br><br>More downtime afterwards, as well as food (veg soup and sardines, which I thought actually was an even better combination than lentil soup and sardines).<br><br>The mattress bag said on it “Caution: may open with force”, but when I opened it, it was done in such a way that it slowly unfurled instead (rather than going “Boom”).</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: A hidden meaning in today's title is that “down” could mean feathers or cosy substance (such as in the mattress).</p>
