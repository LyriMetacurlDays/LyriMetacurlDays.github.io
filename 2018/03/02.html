        <p class="writing">Morning - breakfast, shower, etc.<br><br>I was told that I need at least 3 litres of water every day (not 2). I agree, or maybe more because of the <q>tropical environment</q> of my room, which I kind-of like but can cause dehydration if I'm not careful.<br><br>It was a little colder than yesterday, but not as cold as the day before yesterday. There was a bit more snow though (the most snow so far this year, probably a couple of centimetres on the ground overall).<br><br>On the way to work, I saw a death&#58; a rat ran across the road and dodged some cars, then ran along the path of the cars, and I thought it had a good instinct to avoid being run over. However, it then went under a bus and got run over (not splattered, but more like <q>popped</q> so some of its guts were hanging out, looking like mincemeat, and it was not moving). I noticed another similarly killed rat a few metres away, too.<br><br>I also saw that a little bit of freezing rain had indeed occurred overnight, since there were some big icicles on the pub sign.<br><br>At work, there were not many people (even fewer than yesterday) because most of them were snowed out. We had an early finish.<br><br>I got a little rest and thought that today a lot of time has been generated because of the early finish and because there hadn't been much free time until now.<br><br>When I went back on the Internet, some tabs auto-opened which I had not been on, so I thought perhaps a hacker had somehow accessed it, even though my computer had been off and Opera had been closed. Yet, other tabs I had been on were there. One of the mysterious hacker's tabs was a Google search for "fotis zafiropoulos" followed by a search for "ss87jjm9" (which is probably the hacker's password) (which produced the single result "archive number of all transactions on Forex market 2010-2016"). Another one was a Google search for "appdata local mozilla firefox profiles", followed by  https://www.ghacks.net/2015/12/11/an-analysis-of-firefox-local-cache-locations/, followed by  https://www.ghacks.net/2011/04/23/how-to-clear-a-browser-cache/ - don't worry, those aren't dangerous links but I have not hyperlinked them anyway. Perhaps the hacker tried to clear my browser cache, but forgot to close the tabs, so they reappeared upon startup (even though the Opera settings said to "start a new session"). The hacker had also opened the Opera settings in a tab, maybe to try to edit them to make it more vulnerable. Also, I thought all my Opera bookmarked pages had been cleared (they hadn't really - I found them tomorrow). Deep history had not been cleared, and neither had speed dial, so that was strange.<br><br>My current computer (Monster) often acts like it is really straining (slow programs with the cooling system on full), but the Task Manager doesn't show much intense CPU activity or any strange programs using the most CPU (unless there is a data miner that uses the "system" process to do its work so it shows up as "system" being the top CPU-using program often).<br><br>I tried to look up what happens if some tabs are open which the user didn't go on, but I couldn't find any evidence that this was a common occurrence or had happened to people before.<br><br>Afterwards: Internet and diary updates.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>The First Time Effect</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* This has some similarities to the Mandela effect (see below). However, it is a thing that happens very often to me specifically as a person, which is that something happens which should logically happen very often but has apparently never happened before. Alternatively, it can be some research that should have been completed a long time ago and added to the compendium of Human knowledge in the 19th century at the latest, but in fact has only ever first been discovered right now. Events of today were not quite the First Time Effect, even though many things did happen today for the first time ever in my life (after more than 28 and a half years) (for example, seeing rats getting run over, unknown tabs being auto-opened on startup of Opera (potential hacker), and freezing rain).<br><br>* A true example of the First Time Effect was at the canteen a couple of weeks ago, with the discovery by staff that the use of takeaway boxes can cause spills - surely this has been going on for years so why that day specifically they discovered that this can happen and changed the policy? Another one is when they implemented the one-way system in High School specifically when an accident happened to me (as a person) and not during the previous decades when surely similar accidents had occurred? Also many strange glitches I have recorded in the diaries could fall under the real First Time Effect.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>The Mandela Effect</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* This is a type of mind glitch or universal glitch where you were sure some specific thing had happened or that things were always done a specific way which you can describe in detail, but find out all of a sudden that that thing never happened or isn't done in that way, but another way. This creates the effect of thinking you have just come from a parallel universe where the thing was true, into the current one where it is not (or vice versa).</p>
