        <p class="writing">I met up with Zita today, in Leicester Square, to watch the World Cup Final. We supported Croatia, but we went into a French club (called Global something), and had to pretend we supported France. France won, with quite a bit of luck, because they got a penalty and Croatia scored an own goal. Modric (of Croatia) won the Golden Ball (best player) award, and Harry Kane (of England) won the Golden Boot (most goals) award.<br><br>I thought that bad luck could also be called “Nature tax”.<br><br>Afterwards, we had a walk around London - past St Paul's Cathedral, Old Bailey, across the Millennium Bridge, and under London Bridge. Under London Bridge, there were blue and green lights and the song ‘London Bridge is Falling Down’ playing in a music box tune. It seemed like a nice place for homeless people to sleep.*</p>
		<p class="writing note"><br>* I know the music was designed to annoy them, let me have a joke, stop taking things I say too literally!</p>
		<p class="writing"><br>At the end of the day, I went home, and there was not much time left of this weekend.<br><br>That night, I discovered a creepy spider in my room, which I thought was the closest to being a Creepy 1 that I had seen since the real Creepy 1 (though not as high contrast black and white), and I called it the <q>Homing Spider</q>. I thought it was what I had heard of being called an <q>Invisible spider</q>. It wasn't aggressive. However, I released it outside and put it near a lamp post, and filmed it for a bit. After I had stopped filming, it crawled slowly towards the lamp post (although not as slowly as Creepy 1), like a homing missile, and began going up it. I went back inside.</p>
