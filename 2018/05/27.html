        <h1>Mini Middle Carnian</h1>
<h2>Mini Carnian, Part 2</h2>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 27th <a href="../05.html"><u>May 2018</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r102 nc">&nbsp;102&nbsp;</span> (Fabulous).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Music theme: Spaceflight (Efence).<br>
        YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjjVg9zBnnw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjjVg9zBnnw</a><br>

<p class="note writing">Note: Today's theme is also the theme of the whole Mini Carnian picoera, which is my alternate name for the Spring Bank Holiday Weekend 2018 because the weather strangely switched to be Carnian weather during these three days, and then switched back once it was over.</p>
<p class="note writing">Note: The video for today's theme, at the time, was uploaded by someone who added the scene from &lsquo;Predator&rsquo; where Arnold Schwarzenegger says <q>Stick Around</q>.</p>

        <p class="writing">The rain continued for a few hours, with the lightning storm seeming to go further away and then come closer again. I left the window partially open, and went to sleep at some point.<br><br>I woke up at about 05:30 - even though it felt late!<br><br>I prioritised reading Markus's book, aiming to finish it in the morning. I also had breakfast (mostly cereal). The book lauded agreeableness as a very good and effective trait in both making friends and making spouses, as well as getting along well socially. Which seemed completely contradictory to a lot of videos using Jordan Peterson to say that agreeableness or niceness are very bad traits that will severely limit or completely destroy any success whatsoever (in terms of both career and love life).<br><br>I completed the book, just in time, and had a shower and luneakfast (a lunch that was technically a breakfast because it broke the fast, but was at lunch time).<br><br>Daytime weather: two degrees Celsius hotter than yesterday. I missed the Triassic (maybe we were the species Adelobasileus cromptoni at the time).<br><br>I went to the gym for a personal training session. I got some guidance on building upper body strength, for what exercises to do in the next times (triceps pull, curls, correct way to do lat pulls). At some point, a small spider crawled on my face, and I thought it was a mosquito and then thought it might be a sweat drop. The personal trainer saw it and laughed. It dangled off my face and I caught it on its web line, then attached it to a different machine (it was still left alive and well).<br><br>Back at home, I had some more food and rested. I started reading the books on Advanced Mathematics with Maple (even though I didn't have Maple yet).<br><br>I didn't have a day core sleep, but I did have two ice creams. I hope this doesn't make tomorrow be a worse day than today (due to the sugar negativity effect).<br><br>For the last part of the day, I decided to go on some more Go (Google's programming language) training in the meantime, since I currently intend to practice code mainly on that (because, as I might have mentioned about six or seven months ago, it has apparently the speed of C with the ability of C#, or at least that's the impression I get from the reviews of people who have tried it who aren't biased because they don't have any vested interest in Google).</p>
<h3 class="writing"><br><u>Notes</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>Today was rated 102, perhaps controversially. So I decided, at the time, to give some reasons why today should be rated overperfect, in case I doubt it in the future. Also, this serves as a new step in the refinement of what it means to be overperfect:-</p>
<p class="writing note">* All the sightly negative things were negligible, while the positive things were all major.<br><br>* Unlike the previous days that got rated 98 over the past few years (‘The Medical and the Movie’, ‘Galentine's Day 2016’ and ‘Retro Tonic 3’), I did not have any missed opportunity. Although this was partly because I didn't seek any (this is actually a major factor that made the difference between a rating of 98 vs 102, although if I did seek opportunity and win then the rating would have been even higher, such as 106).<br><br>* I had way too much time in the day and everything was aligned. The future looked very good. Also, when I did things, they got done quickly.<br><br>* Nothing and no one got in my way, even by accident. The housemate below me even seemed to slink away immediately whenever I went downstairs, which was extremely weird, but, on the bright side, convenient.<br><br>* It didn't even rain at all when I was outside, even though it was forecast to do so intermittently. The heat caused some occasional prickles, though.<br><br>* I had to have some exceptions in order to be able to have an overperfect day - if something was slightly bad, that doesn't mean it can't be rated 100 or above if everything else was great. Similarly, in the opposite case, just because something slightly good happened doesn't mean it can't be 0 or less if everything was going to hell.<br><br>* I had some slight detachment from evolved / natural specific hatred - to an extent that it could be detrimental if acted upon practically. Again, this is the mirror opposite of being below 0, in which (I assume) evolved / natural specific love is detached from.<br><br>* Overperfect is still NOT perfect (unlike if a day is rated 100). <br><br>* Euphoria is not necessary for perfection. The music theme was novel enough that it provided a lot of the good feeling today. Combined with the Triassic essence.<br><br>* To have a Fabulous day (that is, rated 101 to 114), it merely needs to exceed the expectations of perfection at the time. To have a Fizz day (115 and above) that probably does require zero negativity and loads of excessive positivity (way over the best expectations) to happen.<br><br>* And, of course, it is all subjective, so, in the end, it was rated 102 because I said so (at the time).</p>
