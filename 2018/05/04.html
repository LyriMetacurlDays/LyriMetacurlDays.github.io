        <p class="writing">I felt like it was 7am, but it was actually 12:30am. This feeling didn't last long, though.<br><br>The air quality in my room, after the clothes were hung out to dry, was questionable.<br><br>I had an extra sleep right away, and forgot to set the alarm, so it ended up being a big core (sleep from about 00:30 to 06:30 naturally).<br><br>Work. When I was there, I only had one cup of weak coffee (I am quitting coffee because I want to increase fertility and serotonin, even at the expense of shortening my lifespan). I couldn't tell if the horrible symptoms I had today (very tired eyes and low attention span) were due to low caffeine or needing more quality sleep. Probably the former.<br><br>I had a sleep and rest from about 17:00 to 19:00.<br><br>Afterwards, I got some samosas and had samosa sandwiches, as well as loads of raspberries (which were “best before” yesterday and I had forgotten about until now). There were two standard packs, which filled a whole big cereal bowl full (I am guessing about 400 grams altogether).<br><br>I found out that Google had changed its input date format back to normal (what it was before 30th of April). Yes! Now I can continue writing up the diary stories on blogspot.<br><br>I wrote up all the rest of the June 2017 stories instead (and published them).<br><br>I also discovered this new song:-</p>
        <p>Subtheme: The Girl and the Robot (Röyksopp).<br>
        YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPqnxFgCrhg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPqnxFgCrhg</a></p>
        <p class="writing"><br>There was a Mandela effect where I found the correct spelling of that band is “Röyksopp”, not “Röyskopp” as I had previously thought. I travelled to the universe where it was spelled the current way at some point between late July 2015 and mid June 2017, because the original entry from the 25th of July 2015 (which I had written) had changed to the new correct spelling, while the entry from the 29th of June 2017 had the old, wrong spelling (which I have corrected now).<br><br>I went for a nap near the end of the day.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today's rating was quite high, considering the caffeine withdrawal symptoms.</p>
