        <p class="writing note">Note: I think, in today's theme song, the Triassic part is 0:00 to 1:30, the Jurassic part is 1:30 to 3:09 and the Cretaceous part is 3:09 to 5:22. That is similar relative times to how long the actual periods lasted.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>After sleep, I had a shower and went to Work. It was pretty uneventful for the most part.<br><br>When I got back, a ladybird landed on me and I picked it up. It did its smelly liquid and I threw it away (still alive of course, because they are a cute type of bug).<br><br>Then I noticed there were a lot of ladybirds flying around the front of the house, possibly all out to socialise and mate with one another. Something about the house seems to attract them. I remembered that when I first came in on ‘10th Headquarters’, there were quite a few ladybird corpses in the room (which had died over Winter and been dried out due to the intense radiator heat).<br><br>Upstairs, I found that about 7 ladybirds had managed to crawl into 10th Headquarters and were now crawling all over the curtains and ceiling. One by one, I made them fall onto my hand, opened the window and tipped them off, then they flew away (they tend to fly when they're falling).<br><br>I went to the big Tesco and got a lot of stuff, including two amber beers called Gem (by Bath Ales), a Mythos and a Hop House Lager 13.<br><br>Tea was a pizza, with olives and mushrooms. I had a mix of Gem and Mythos, to make the combination of ‘Mythic Gem’ beer, which was definitely better than either component, so a good mix.<br><br>I planned to take the rubbish to the dump tomorrow before the Landladi comes and charges “everyone”.<br><br>I listened to some music, and discovered today's theme for the first time, even though it's on the same album as ‘4.5 Billion Years’ which I discovered over seven years ago).<br><br>I noticed that there were a few more ladybirds that started making noise and flying around, like they had become frustrated with my room because it's too enclosed. So I threw them out of the landing window, which they liked.</p>
