        <p class="note writing">Although today was the first day of 2004, it was actually the <b>second</b> entry in the main paper diaries. Tomorrow's entry was the first.<br><br></p>
    <p class="writing">Today's weather&#58; Cloudy and Wet.<br><br>That night I slept in my bed in 3rd Headquarters (yet again yeah).<br><br>Breakfast was Oat Krunchies.<br><br>I started work on constructing the model of a Manned V2 (one of my Christmas 2003 presents), then tidied upstairs for an hour.<br><br>Afterwards, I went to the Normal Walk. At the Normal Walk, the Viscount stood in a one-millimetre-deep wet patch on the road, and for some reason, this greatly angered the Overgod.<br><br>Dinner was tomato sauce pasta.<br><br>In the next few hours, I worked on and COMPLETED the Manned V2 model. With today's work done, I went downstairs and watched the DVD of &lsquo;Sinbad&#58; Legend of the Seven Seas&rsquo; (a cartoon Sinbad).<br><br>Tea was cheese and pickle buns and chicken flavour crisps.<br><br>I talked to the Emperor about the models of the T34/76 and T34/85 (Russian WWII tanks) and Jagdpanzer (German).<br><br>Supper was crushed Oat Krunchies.<br><br>Back in 3rd Headquarters, I played some &lsquo;Quake&rsquo; on the Packard Bell computer (a.k.a. <q>Computer 4</q>).<br><br>I also read pages 22 to 26 of &lsquo;The Silmarillion&rsquo; by J. R. R. Tolkien, then went to sleep.</p>
