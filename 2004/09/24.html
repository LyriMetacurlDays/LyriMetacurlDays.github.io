        <p class="writing">School.<br><br>‘Descent’ – Completed ‘Lunar Military Base’ (that is, Level 3). Started Level 4 (‘Venus Atmospheric Lab’).<br><br>Went to Hgwrtz for our first night there.<br><br>Lots of fun at Hgwrtz. We found out that the previous occupant had the same name as the deputy from Overheaven School (but they had a different first name).<br><br>I was sitting on the sofa next to the Emperor and the Princess. I had to screw the handles onto the little chest of drawers for the living room. I listened to today's music theme song (which was track 6 of my ‘Descent 2’ CD) as I did it.<br><br>When I had finished screwing the handles onto the drawers, the Princess was trying to do hand-stands and see how long she could hold it. For counting the time upside-down, I made it extra intense by putting on another track (track 9 of my ‘Descent 2’ CD), which is today's subtheme.<br><br>That night, when it was dark, we were alone in Hgwrtz. We thought it was haunted. We switched the lights off and sat on the sofa, motionless. We heard some footsteps in the hall, the room behind ours. It was the ghost / monster of Hgwrtz.<br><br>The Emperor said that if you stand under the archway in a haunted house, your soul gets stolen. I didn't believe him, so I deliberately stood in the archway between the living room and the dining room, in the dark. We all went silent.<br><br>This was my first ever night in Hgwrtz.</p>
