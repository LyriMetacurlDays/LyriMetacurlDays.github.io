    <p class="writing note">Note&#58; The title mainly comes from &lsquo;PCOC&rsquo;, which stands for &lsquo;Perfect Completion of Coursework&rsquo;. Also, it suits the slight information about Peacock Farm (near the Space Ship), which I heard two days ago (but didn't record).</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>In the small hours, I listened to &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; and some &lsquo;Command &amp Conquer&rsquo; songs - &lsquo;Canyon Chase&rsquo;, &lsquo;Airstrike&rsquo; and &lsquo;Roll Out&rsquo;. Eventual sleep at 04:20.<br><br>Woken up by alarm at 08:12, but got up at 09:45.<br><br>Sorted the washed clothes.<br><br>Had breakfast. Updated diary. Then it was 11:20.<br><br>Eventually got Lai coursework1 under way, then it was 13:20.<br><br>&lsquo;Fire in the Kilt&rsquo; track 14 was in my head for now, instead of &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;.<br><br>Slightly updated diary (5 mins).<br><br>Dinner – Tuna and cheese toasties.<br><br>&lsquo;Fire in the Kilt&rsquo; track 18 then went into my head when I was trying to cancel out the feeling that &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; gives me, as that feeling was stopping my motivation to complete coursework. Unfortunately, &lsquo;Fire in the Kilt&rsquo; songs are indifferent to &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;, so it didn't stop the feeling.<br><br>But I managed to get out of the feeling by various combinations, and that included listening to the &lsquo;Fortree City and Hoenn Secret Base&rsquo; music on repeat.<br><br>From about 14:40 to 15:20, the theme was &lsquo;Sudden Strike&rsquo; track 9 (which I called &lsquo;Mansion&rsquo;).<br><br>From about 15:20 to 16:40, I listened to others, mostly &lsquo;Radioactivity&rsquo; (Minimum Maximum version by Kraftwerk) (Repeating) (which is an RPT theme – RPT stands for repeating), and did the majority of Lai Coursework1.<br><br>From about 16:40 to 17:20 the theme went back to &lsquo;Sudden Strike&rsquo; track 9.<br><br>Tea – Quorn and <q>spaghetti lines</q> (canned spaghetti with tomato sauce), with cabbage. The can of <q>spaghetti lines</q> was one of the things from the Yeoman's box of supplies.<br><br>I phoned the Yeoman and the Captain. They were still fine.<br><br>Completed Lai Coursework1 and PREN1010 Test 10&semi; all ready for submission except for the Ding2 Coursework.<br><br>Eventually I completed Ding2, while listening to &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;, then listened to &lsquo;Leave Right Now&rsquo; (Will Young). That became one of the sub-themes of the day, along with &lsquo;Sudden Strike&rsquo; Track 9, and the two RPT themes I made today&#58; &lsquo;Kraft (RPT)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Section of Lone Troop&rsquo;. They can be found on my YouTube channel (Lyri Metacurl with a green logo).<br><br>All courseworks done now. The agenda list for courseworks is now empty - a state it was last in in mid-September 2007.<br><br>I made a playlist for this legendary day. First &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;, then &lsquo;Sudden Strike&rsquo; Track 9 twice, then &lsquo;Kraft (RPT)&rsquo; for 1 minute, then &lsquo;Leave Right Now&rsquo;.<br><br>The day seemed to last loads and loads longer than the 6th of December 2007 (which was renwoned for feeling very long), and I eventually left it to history (or at least I'd better once I finish writing here). The time is 27:47 (a.k.a. 3:47 AM tomorrow). Goodnight everybody.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note&#58; I decided today that the happiness rating is 99 (the first time I had ever given this rating to a day). Making it the new second-best day on record so far, and beating &lsquo;The Maretarium&rsquo; into third place.</p>
