        <p class="writing note">Note: Today was the second predicted day of ‘The Universe <s>Explodes</s> Blows Up’ scenario (weird for Sunday?) because of the LHC. This one was predicted by the Emperor on the original ‘Planet Destroide’ day, but it was soon discovered to be wrong and moved ahead to 21st October 2008. Thus this prediction was invalid!</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>This is one of those intermittent days of “freedom” to complete things I thought would not happen.<br><br>I had a dream of going to Overheaven School at night and all the people in my old class were dancing around in a circle. Quite ghostly. I joined them, and many of them disappeared. There were only a few left, mainly Romy and Nadir, who were both then at the Boss and Wizard's house with me, and Romy said she had been ignoring me because she “wanted me to feel really bad” as punishment.<br><br>When I woke up at about 07:00, I realised that my nice conversation with Romy never happened and she's an “idiot” at Manchester, even though she's the last of her kind (she is an only child).<br><br>I got up pretty much straight away (07:00) and had three cups of water to rehydrate.<br><br>I invented a story like ‘Finding Nemo’ but called ‘The Last Scuttlefish’, which is about a fish that was the last of its kind, and he was really nice, and in the end, he gets eaten by a seal, like a snack. This was to remind me of the kind of things that happen all the time. I compared it with Romy, who will end up probably getting with the wrong kind of guy, thus her line will essentially end. Or else she will not even have any children at all, which is a likely possibility.<br><br>I properly got up at about 10:00, thinking of the fact that the Overgod was here only one week ago.<br><br>I saw a Jehowa's Witness leaflet about the Bible “explaining life's problems”.<br><br>I did the Aspen HYSYS coursework (and updated the diary more in the middle of doing the coursework). At this time, I was listening to ‘Kraft’ (RPT) at first.<br><br>Then I listened to ‘Bubble Beach’ (TPCi) on repeat. There was a similar windy sound happening outside.<br><br>When I thought I had completed the Aspen coursework, I listened to ‘Lost Impact’ (Jun Senoue) and thought of a portal like the one in Treasure Planet that could lead ANYWHERE and ANYTIME in the entire multiverse, including the ‘Lost Impact’ place in ‘Shadow the Hedgehog’ (which the music is from).<br><br>I had no dinner today, but at about 12:50 I finished the peanuts I had bought six days ago.<br><br>I completed the LX27 report today also, as far as I know.<br><br>Suddenly, I found (without even realising) the black pen that I had used to update the diary loads before (I had evidently lost it seventeen days ago and had resorted to using a blue pen, until now).<br><br>I made a cup of tea and had two slices of marmite toast.<br><br>Later, tea (meal) was beans and toast (separately).<br><br>I tried to solve the prime numbers (EPIC FAIL).<br><br>On the TV, I watched the movie ‘Saw 2’, from 23:00 to 25:00 (today was the official 25 hour day due to daylight savings).</p>
