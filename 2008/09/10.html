        <p class="writing"><br>Mouth Pop problem: Universal glitch reactivated. Perhaps no recovery is possible, therefore the Universe shall end.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Events of the Day</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>On TV was a ‘Star Trek: The Next Generation’ episode in which the USS 1701­C Enterprise comes to the future and changes it so it must be sent to the past to change it back.<br><br>I, the Emperor and the Princess discussed the end of the world and stuff.<br><br>Went on Laptop 4 for a bit.<br><br>About 02:39, I listened to my heavy energy music (subthemes) - &lsquo;Militant Force&rsquo; (Frank Klepacki) and &lsquo;Five Minutes&rsquo; (The Stranglers).<br><br>Also I listened to today's music theme (&lsquo;Kill Ratio&rsquo; by Sonic Mayhem), due to it being about 6 hours until the planet's destruction.<br><br>Went to sleep.<br><br>About 09:00, I watched the activation of the CERN Particle Accelerator (Large Hadron Collider / LHC) on the BBC.<br><br>The planet did not get destroyed. Well, it wouldn't anyway because (as we found out) the experiment will not take place fully for at least another month. The Emperor predicts it will be on 26th October 2008.<br><br>Note from the Future: Due to many setbacks, the actual date ended up being 30th March 2010. However, by then, none of us even knew...<br><br>Breakfast: Honey Oat Clusters.<br><br>I played two or three levels of ‘Halo 2’ (starting with Metropolis).<br><br>Dinner: Chunky chicken and vegetable soup, with ham, cottage cheese and lettuce butties.<br><br>Tea: Semi-chicken-drummers (battered, small versions), salad, potato, coleslaw and other stuff.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note 1: Today's title was originally spelled correctly, but it was changed to the current spelling online because it was always based on a disaster scene which the Viscount drew many years ago, which said “Planet Destroide” on it. I and the Emperor teased him for his spelling mistake at the time, and he got really embarrassed and wanted to Destroy the picture, but I saved it as a relic for a while. However, I think it got thrown in the bin at some point.<br><br>Note 2: Today's music theme was partly chosen for its destructive sound and partly chosen because the operator of the LHC would have the highest Kill Ratio in the world if it destroyed the world.<br><br>Note 3: Coincidentally, using the formula I discussed on 1st May 2008, my sentience power points reach 600 billion today.</p>
