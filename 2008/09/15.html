        <p class="writing note">Note: This is considered to be one the absolute most significant historical days ever, according to <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss–Howe_generational_theory">Strauss–Howe generational theory</a></u>, the theory of the <q>80-year cycle</q> of history repeating itself. This day marks the end of the 3rd Turning (Unravelling, or Autumn) and start of the 4th Turning (Crisis, or Winter). There is some disagreement about the exact day of various other turnings, such as if the Unravelling started at the falling of the Berlin Wall or some time in 1984, but this day is considered to be definite.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Shower.<br><br>Breakfast.<br><br>About 12:00 to 16:00, I registered for voting and looked in the Merrion Centre and St. John's Centre. In Woolworths, there was not much there. In the phone shop, they didn't sell batteries.<br><br>“Lunch” was mushroom soup (second half) and cheese on rye bread.<br><br>“Tea” was cabbage and rice with tuna mixture (with a small tuna tin and half a can of condensed chicken soup).<br><br>I phoned Hgwrtz.<br><br>The Wizard phoned also, at about 20:30.<br><br>I put my clothes in the washing machine (to see if it was successful).<br><br>I discovered a letter from the 20th of August, from npower, that said if they aren't called within fourteen days, they would cut off the electricity to the house. I wondered why they still haven't done it ten days after the deadline. Anyway, the Bone should sort it out. Since he was in the house on 20th of August, and I wasn't.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note 1: Unknown to me at the time, on the news the financial crisis / credit crunch began today. Today was nicknamed ‘Meltdown Monday’, as opposed to ‘Black Thursday’ of 1929, as this is the biggest financial crisis since 1929 (the start of the great depression).<br><br>Note 2: I have a theory that Meltdown Monday may partly be caused by people's rash, short-term decisions that they made because they didn't know if the world would end five days ago.</p>
