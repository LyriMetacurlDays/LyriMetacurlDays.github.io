        <h1>Not So Positive</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 16th <a href="../07.html"><u>July 2005</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r95 nc">&nbsp;95&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>

        <p class="writing note">Note: The real music theme of the day was awesome, but I could never find it anywhere. I did a graphic score of it at the time, but it just is basically “1, 1, 1, 2” so I assume you can't imagine what it was like just from that information. Someone somewhere knows it though&#33; For example, the composer (Dru Masters).<br><br>Almost fourteen years later, I managed to find something that sounds so much like my distant memory of it that it could actually be it (and was also made by the same guy who made the real theme, at around the same time), so it can be the acting theme unless I find out that it isn't the real one. Here:</p>

        <p class="writing">Breakfast.<br><br>‘Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince’ (2005) came. On Classic FM, it showed the event of this book coming as one of completely ‘100%’ guaranteed. What miserable lives they must have.<br><br>Did the green chapter tags for Harry Potter Book 6.<br><br>Updated diary.<br><br>Peach Bark.<br><br>Asda and Homebase (shops).<br><br>Bike ride from town centre to Eglinton Park.<br><br>Did some target practice with the Wizard. Used the air rifle.<br><br>Dinner: Indian hot spicy dinner. Red curry = positive spice (hot). Yellow curry = negative spice (anti-hot).<br><br>Comparing power types for human bodies (examples):-<br><br>* The Emperor: Battery powered (runs out easily).<br><br>* The Viscount: Solar powered (sun increases power).<br><br>* The Boss: Anti-solar powered (sun reduces power, food provides power).<br><br>* Everything (including above): Fuel powered.<br><br>Tea break.<br><br>Watched ‘Are You Younger Than You Think’ with the Boss and the Wizard. Digital ‘Young Or Old’ tests. While watching it, I became incredibly conscious of my heart, which made me laugh (the sensation of it beating in my chest).<br><br>One of the green tags was put in the paper diary page with the graphic score of the theme. However I could never remember it, only that it was really good and ambient.<br><br>Finished chapter 2 of ‘Seven Brothers’.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Today was the new best day on record and also the first day to be confirmed to achieve the status of “the best day of the best month of my life”. Which is subtly different from “the best day of my life”, which was still &lsquo;The Sleeping Policeman&rsquo; at the time.<br><br>* I am 100% sure that for me there was no better month than July 2005 previously, so this is a definite holder of the prize. The previous holder was not on record, so it remains unknown, but a good bet might be August 1994, which would mean that &lsquo;The Sleeping Policeman&rsquo; had both prizes.<br><br>* Today held the prize for five years and seven months, before it was finally beaten by &lsquo;Belland Lemon&rsquo;.</p>
