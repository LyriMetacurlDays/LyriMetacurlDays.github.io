        <p class="writing">Although I thought this was a lost memory like most of the days around it, there is quite a lot of video footage from this day, so this entry will be expanded on with time.<br><br>The Original Trio watched &lsquo;Charlotte's Web&rsquo;, and this was partly filmed by the Overgod when the song &lsquo;We've Got Lots In Common&rsquo; came on, and more clips.<br><br>Afternoon - There is a memory I have always attributed to today, although the real date (even the year) is actually unknown, but I might as well put it in today's entry as well: I was walking in Overheaven by myself, near the School, and there was a truck driving around playing Christmas songs, and it played &lsquo;Fairytale Of New York&rsquo; by The Pogues. I thought it wouldn't be allowed because it had mild swear words in it and kids could hear it. Although I was already very familiar with the previous track, which says the F word loads, so I didn't care personally.<br><br>Evening - The main event was recorded on video.<br><br>We opened our presents. The Princess got the biggest present, which was a rocking horse. This became a major thing for the next few years or so.</p>
