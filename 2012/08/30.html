        <p class="writing">From ‘The Jeremy Kyle Show’, ‘The Wright Stuff’ and ‘This Morning’, I could clearly see that my life has a lot of negativity coming from outside, from negative people as the primary source. Some people actually have a happy expression when saying how disgusted they are with something, and conveying that they are indeed disgusted but that it feels good (to them) to be disgusted.<br><br>I and the Yeoman went to the dump and Lidl.<br><br>Dinner was amazing.<br><br>Tea was curry and rice.<br><br>I had a walk near the canal, and saw a wild cat.<br><br>Upstairs, in the aft quarter of the Space Ship, I bathed in the light of the blue moon, and thought about how good today is.<br><br>On ‘Personality Café’ I talked about Se (extraverted sensing) and Ni (introverted intuition).<br><br>The Yeoman and the Captain went for their night out. Meanwhile, I watched the documentary on Eyjafjallajokull and volcanoes.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today's subtheme is because of that volcano documentary.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>I looked up VEI numbers (theoretically VEI 9 is virtually impossible and has never happened on Earth, although the closest possible one they think was a possible VEI 8 somewhere approximately Brazil, ages ago, which they think may have ejected about 8500 cubic kilometres of magma (the category for VEI 9 is 10,000 to 100,000 cubic kilometres of magma spewed out).</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: The only things in this day that were <q>bad</q> were the smell of nail polish, having a spotty back, and lack of euphoria (but I didn't care much!!). Today's goodness rating was 98 (which is the same as the best day of 2006, so, at the time, it was joint third-place in the entire record).</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Today was the new holder of this prize, having beaten &lsquo;Time is the Enemy&rsquo;. It retained the prize for seven months, then was beaten by &lsquo;Awkwardness&rsquo;.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of the Best Year of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Today also beat &lsquo;Time is the Enemy&rsquo; in this department. It kept this prize for one year, then it was beaten by &lsquo;Awkwardness&rsquo;.</p>
