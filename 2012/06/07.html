        <p class="writing">I did lots of PhD work.<br><br>I was deliberately late for Leeds City Toastmasters. I arrived at Crowne Plaza Hotel about 19:40 and then waited for the break. Today's theme song was on in the toilets, and it was extremely good so I found out what it was by looking up the lyrics.<br><br>The Toastmasters meeting finished at 21:40. I saw someone do their 10th speech! Also, I was the only one who had waterproof trousers on at the time, despite the rain.<br><br>I went to the Real Ale Society from about 22:00 to 23:30.<br><br>Today felt so long that it was UNBELIEVABLE. I also remembered it really vividly, despite not much being recorded.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: This was just a stand-alone day called ‘The Verge’ until four and a half years later when I was going to give another day the same name, so I had to distinguish it by calling that one ‘The Verge of Darkness’, which then eventually made today be also known as ‘The Verge of Lightness’. Also it's extra appropriate because ‘The Verge of Darkness’, which then eventually made today be also known as ‘The Verge of Lightness’, is in June and ‘The Verge of Darkness’ is in December.</p>
