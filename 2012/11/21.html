        <p class="writing note">Note: The theme is actually a different song to the theme of ‘Brodick Bay Beach’ – not that I would expect anyone to remember that entry by now because it was so long ago&#33;</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Quote of the day: <q>There is no ‘I’ in ‘team’, but there is in ‘win’.</q> &mdash; Often attributed to Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>10:00 – Weekly Meeting #42.<br><br>16:00 – Presentation by a fellow PhD student.<br><br>I installed and played an emulation of ‘Shadow the Hedgehog’ (the Gamecube version). It seemed harder than the PS2 version, but I think that was just because I was controlling it with the keyboard rather than a gamepad. So I ordered a gamepad for Monster (the laptop).</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Riddle</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* What cut the thread of trying to prove the author's qualities?</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Memos</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* It's egocentric to try to resist the external world. Sylfaen would therefore just go with the flow of the moment (even when meetings are on), accepting any words that are said about it because I am not an essential part of this or any universe – I am merely an observer, here to feel the world and be part of it.<br><br>* The definition of “ruminanting” (from yesterday) is “being lost in thoughts related to self, especially trying to prove to yourself or anyone that you are NOT egocentric or Cursed, because that is very ironic. Ruminanting is very sick and sadistic. <s>S</s><br><br>* Practice not saying “I” or “me” at all. Notice that true dominant peoples' words comprise only “commands” and “statements”, and that this is extremely effective at avoiding the words “I” and “me”. You can say “you”, “we”, “our”, etcetera (but not in the way that Gollum says it!!).<br><br>* You can refer to yourself if you use third person. It's a lot of fun!</p>
