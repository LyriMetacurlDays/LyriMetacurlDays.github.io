        <p class="writing">I woke up thinking that the Overgod had said I eat too much food which I had stuffed in the fridge. However, it was an illusion (he actually was not here until the afternoon).<br><br>I hoovered up the hall, stairs, landing and 4th Headquarters, as part of the flea extermination effort.<br><br>Many hours were then spent watching YouTube videos with the Baroness.<br><br>The Overgod came in the afternoon and took us to the Concrete Walk, around the nature reserve. I did some modelling there.<br><br>On the way back, we bought some Barr bubblegum pop (the drink) and Dandelion &amp; Burdock.<br><br>I discovered the song <q>I'll Fly with You</q> (Gigi D'Agostino). There are quite a few versions so I saved the best version and put the Blablabla version today.<br><br>The Overgoddess got her recorder and started playing it over every music video that was on, so I didn't get to properly listen to the best version of <q>I'll Fly with You</q> until later.<br><br>I listened to some bubblegum pop music while drinking bubblegum pop, so it counted as a bubblegum pop party.<br><br>I went to Mt Bump with the Overgod and the Viscount. The Emperor joined us too.<br><br>We watched <q>The Mandalorian</q> episodes 7 and 8 at home, then some of the start of <q>Alita&colon; Battle Angel</q> (about the first ten minutes).</p>
