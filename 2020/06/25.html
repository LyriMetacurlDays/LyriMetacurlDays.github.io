        <p class="writing note">Note: The correct version of today's music theme is about 8:05 in length.<br><br>Note: This was the hottest day of 2020 for me (due to location, it was hotter than 31st July 2020).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Weather: Dry heat wave. 31&#176;C.<br><br>Sleep. Uncomfortable night, due to heat.<br><br>Work. There was this strange quantum glitch on the Internet that had been happening over the past few days, where it would cut off at a critical time but then when I looked at the router (in the next room) then it would act as if it never cut off in the first place.<br><br>I tried the "Quantum Look" test - I waited and went back and forth without actually looking at the router, and the Internet stayed disabled. But then, as soon as I actually looked at the router a few seconds later, it was fully working, and worked as if it was never having a problem.<br><br>The same thing happened almost every day this week at some point, and it was not necessarily timed with anyone else using the Internet, but just around 11:something. It was around 11:14 today but on a previous day it was around 11:57, at the very end of a conference call. Fortunately, it has not happened during my speech - at least for now.<br><br>So far, in 100&#37; of cases, it has been on my Work Laptop, and also in 100&#37; of cases, it was resolved <em>only</em> by <em>LOOKING</em> at the wireless router. Next time, I thought, I will wait five minutes before looking, to try to prove it wrong.<br><br>After work, I had a walk, from about 15:45 to 17:15. This was the part when it was 30&#176;C (or so I thought, while the weather says it was 31&#176;C here at the time). I went on the old path around the Mine Lake, with some plant cutters. I had not been there for ten years, and it had become disused and quite overgrown. I cut through the overgrown parts that were blocking the path - mostly brambles, nettles and Himalayan balsam. However, the balsam often covered up the nettles, which caused me to get stung by them.<br><br>Further up, I tried finding a way to the upper path (which was now extremely hard to get to because the farmer had cut the area off from the public). Once I managed that, which involved cutting a lot of brambles and bashing them down with a fence pole, I got to the Plains.<br><br>There, I tried exploring the upper paths at the Plains, but got chased by horse flies (predators), which put me off, and I headed home.<br><br>At around 19:30, some of us went shopping at Aldi.<br><br>Then the rest of the day happened.</p>
