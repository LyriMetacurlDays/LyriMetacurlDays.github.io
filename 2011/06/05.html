        <p class="writing note">Note: Today's theme really suits June. Also, today counts as one of the exceedingly rare days where the title equals the theme track name (because that includes confirmed alternative titles) (&lsquo;Happy Toto Time 14&rsquo; is the original title).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>No events were recorded today. Mostly, I will have been reading more of ‘The Mating Mind’ by Geoffrey Miller.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Memos</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Superstition about life is abundant and is being revealed and subsequently destroyed, especially by the book ‘The Mating Mind’ by Geoffrey Miller.<br><br>
* The creative thoughts I had during reading today included the principle of “neediness” being an unfitness indicator – in principle, since everyone is different, an individual would feel neediness towards a particular member of the opposite sex primarily because the “needed” individual displays higher fitness than them. Which means the “needer” is assuming lower fitness.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Today won this prize, having beaten &lsquo;Rich Friday&rsquo;. It retained the prize for a year and two months, then was beaten by &lsquo;Part of Something&rsquo;.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of the Best Year of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Today was also <q>the best day of the best month of the best year of my life</q>, another subtly different prize. It is not certain what the previous holder of this prize was, since it is very hard to tell whether a year before 2004 would have been better than 2010. If so, then it would also depend on which was the best month of that year, not the best day of that year.<br><br>If 2010 was indeed the previous best year of my life, then &lsquo;2 Dec&rsquo; would have been the previous holder. Today held this prize for one year, again beaten by &lsquo;Part of Something&rsquo;.</p>
