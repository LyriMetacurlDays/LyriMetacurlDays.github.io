        <p class="writing note">Note: Today got a 93 goodness rating, so it was one of the best (as good as the best day of 2010 anyway). Also, somehow, I missed today (emotionally) even while it was happening. I hated to see this day go.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>I had a dream with Pier in it. I also had a dream with Romy in it.<br><br>I went to the co-op.<br><br>Dinner: Thai green curry, jasmine rice, sweetcorn and Kingsmill Omega 3 bread slices. This dinner was really sentimental and associated with today.<br><br>Also, Enjay was the woman which I was most in love with at this time. In my MEng dissertation, as a hidden tribute to Enjay, the subscript order I used was <i>i</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>j</i>, when <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>n</i> would be a more logical choice.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Analysis of Conscience</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Conscience is a horrible negative emotion that occurs when one does something which one judges as being bad. Is it because one fears punishment&#63; It shouldn't be. It is the emotion of morality, so it is also the feeling of self-righteousness when one does something which one judges as being good.<br><br>* Stage 6 (in Kohlberg’s stages of moral development) would say that the negative emotion of conscience is from doing something that might decrease the beauty of the big picture, whereas the positive emotion of conscience is from doing something that might increase the beauty of the big picture.<br><br>* However, according to Doctor Paul's polarisation, ‘intuition’ balances conscience, and aiming towards success requires a balance. ‘Intuition’ (in Doctor Paul's sense) is knowledge of whether one is in a good (or bad) situation or environment. An over-balance of this ‘intuition’ CAUSES both increased manipulation of others and increased awareness of when one is being manipulated. An over-balance of conscience, conversely, CAUSES both an increase in how much one is manipulated by others and increased awareness of when one is being manipulative towards others.</p>
