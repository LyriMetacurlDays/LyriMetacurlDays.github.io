        <p class="writing"><br>* I must remember to have my degree certificate behind my blazer, especially when I have my PhD certificate, like out of ‘I lost on Jeopardy’ (‘Weird Al’ Yankovic). [Done, done, done, done&#33;]<br><br>* Remember to say how I'm officially the best in the class &gt;&#58;D [Done]<br><br>* Remember to try to go to Level 14 in the Edward Boyle Library. [Done, done&#33;]</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Events</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>The Overgod, the Overgoddess, the Boss and the Wizard were there. I went to the gown hire place to have the Master's costume on.<br><br>I graduated successfully.<br><br>There was a buffet afterwards, in the Parkinson Building (that was actually the Mechanical Engineering buffet, apparently, although the Chemical Engineering class and staff were all there and we had our photos taken).<br><br>There was also a point when I was asked by a TV company (probably LUTV) to give my opinion on accessibility of education, and I think I did quite well, saying that I think everyone should have access to education because there are many hidden genii in the world who would be able to shine if they had education.<br><br>After the events were done, the others left. Then I finished reading all of the rest of the book ‘Evolution of Desire’ by David Buss (there was a total of 12 chapters altogether).</p>
