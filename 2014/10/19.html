        <p class="writing">About 03:00 I woke up in the middle of the night and felt sad about yesterday's conversation with Rachine and Spiritual Mark. I played a bit of the Computer Game, and there was this (mentally) intimate moment in it where the people in the computer game were being human, properly soul-to-soul, which is unfortunately so rare in today's society. It's sad because we live in a time when you can get more of a genuine taste of humanity from a role playing game than you can from the <q>real world</q>. The Shauna music (today's subtheme) was on at the time.<br><br>Somehow I went back to sleep again, probably about 04:00 to 10:00.<br><br>DC texted about 17:00 asking if I want to go out for a curry. He came over about 18:30 and we ended up going to Tariq's Restaurant. This was the <q>Curry Fix</q>, as DC referred to it. I discovered a new favourite song today (&lsquo;Janet&rsquo; by Commodores), which ended up being today's theme because it sounded like the Shauna music.<br><br>There were also some other songs in the curry house and DC's car, such as:-</p>
        <p><br>Nightshift (Commodores).
        <br><br>Easy (Commodores).
        <br><br>Brick House (Commodores).
        <br><br>Real Love (Clean Bandit feat. Jess Glynn).
        <br><br>Spice (Sweet Norma Jones).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>I and DC went to 8th Headquarters to listen to the tracks (above). Upon DC's suggestion, I messaged 'Nightshift' (Commodores) to Raw because he was doing a nightshift at the time.<br><br>It was raining very heavily outside. I got back to playing the Computer Game to progress further. DC left after a while once a few more music tracks had played.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note from the future: Today was officially the best day of 2014. The entire day was very relaxed and perfect. I could not see a thing wrong with it, so if I still did ratings at the time, it would have had to have had gotten a 99. By the way, the grammar in the previous sentence was a deliberate subtle reference to &lsquo;Bioshock Infinite&rsquo;. So don't complain&#33;</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Year of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* It is not 100&#37; certain if there was a year before 2010 that beat 2010 in terms of average rating. However, since then, this prize has just been the same as the Best Day of the Year prize until now. 2014 has still not been beaten (as of the latest update of this page) so this prize is still kept by today.</p>
