        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: The <q>Bud version</q> can be formed from combining the start of the short version with the bulk of the original version (a good approximation is to listen to the short version to about 47 seconds and then switch to the original version at about 1 minute and 20 seconds into that, but then the ending is the same as the short one rather than the original one). There used to be at least two actual videos of it which I thought was the only version of the song at the time.<br><br>Normally I wouldn't allow this, but since it is extremely unlikely for any other days to dare to claim either the short or original versions of this song, both of the above wrong versions can be today's theme as well. Actually, the short version is pretty much the exact right theme, just that it doesn't last as long as the true correct theme. The spotify version appears to be the Bud version also.<br><br>Spotify Link: https://play.spotify.com/track/4jCNHUzisjjHa6jrzaoyOz<br><br>Old YouTube Link which may have been the Bud version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sWd1exDfX4<br><br>Note: The video has been removed, so now I have to describe the visuals in it&#58; It showed a pink flowery ground and water montage, and blue sky with some clouds, in a loop, while the song ‘Gopala Hare’ (Wah) (Bud version) was on.</p>

        <p class="writing"><br>That morning, I told Bray about it and he said “Govinda” means “Buddha”, which was another “synchronicity” with it being called the “Bud version”. However, today I thought the song was called ‘Govinda Gopala’, when its real name is ‘Gopala Hare’.<br><br>Before breakfast, we did an Ashtanga session with Yogi Jace.<br><br>Breakfast was very similar to yesterday, but with no poppy seeds or ‘Opium’ songs.<br><br>In the day time, it was quite sunny. We went to the lake and The Head, and chanted “Om” and “Sat Nam” in it. We relaxed in the sun. Today was even more beautiful than yesterday.<br><br>After the trip, I sat next to Han Solar and she told me about her diet, for example gluten-free and low sugar. I told her about the time I went gluten-free in November to December 2013, and my face was less puffy apparently. She said I should quit gluten again.<br><br>That afternoon there was another Kundalini session with Rachine, but much more relaxed than yesterday's.<br><br>I set up the sauna before Tea Time, and it was warming up for quite some time.<br><br>I went with Bray, Nicko and Yogi Jace into the sauna, and we kept putting steam on the rocks and feeling the warm rushes from that, and talking like we were “sauna junkies”. If anyone was listening to us saying things like “let's have another shot”, “ahhhh” they would think something was up.<br><br>I made a cup of tea and then Captain Cheery tried to hug me when I was holding it by accident, so it splashed all over my hands. Then in this tranquil, peaceful environment, I shouted a loud swear word! I then tried to cool my hand down but the water was hot first then cold. Luckily, it wasn't too bad despite this.<br><br>That evening, we did the Yoga Fusion performance with the 5 people present from the 10 at the original performance (Me, Niki, Han Solar, Captain Cheery and Charlie).<br><br>That night, I went deeper into Spiral Dyamics Fourth Tier by feeling the “sheer force” of all the good that could be happening right now but wasn't because people don't think it's possible and are too controlled by their own horrible preconceptions. The flipside is that if you partly "phase in" to that and imagine it happening right now - the alternate universe of positivity - you can bring all that “positive energy" right into this world like a portal.<br><br>I thought this was “beyond antifragility”. Tapping into the maximum positivity situation that you can imagine could happen in the real world, most often neglected because other people don't make it happen.</p>
