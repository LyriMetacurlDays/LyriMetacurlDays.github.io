        <p class="writing">I was awake for some time in the middle of the night, but I thought the new sleep schedule was already ruined, so I decided to have a big block of sleep instead. Got up about 09:00. I was wondering about the coffee, so I opened the freezer and there was an intense smell of mould. I had left the doors closed and the fridge-freezer off for 2 weeks and not turned it on when I got back yesterday.<br><br>I closed the freezer door and switched it on. Hopefully, that would kill the mould. I wondered if the opened coffee inside the tin would be infected? I'd find out later. Today I would have to buy my coffee at Caf√© Maia instead.<br><br>I went to The Building, into my office.<br><br>I got back about 14:00. The maintenance man was there, and he said he's replacing the doors in the rooms, to put fire-proof sealant there, as it needed to meet the new regulations or standards.<br><br>Upstairs, I checked the freezer. The tin had frozen to the floor of the freezer, but I managed to move it and opened it. The coffee inside looked and smelled fine. It's probably OK.<br><br>I tried to go to sleep for my afternoon nap, as the Maintenance Man was working, so it was a bit noisy. I set the alarm for 16:00, hoping to sleep from 14:30 - 16:00.<br><br>However, I couldn't get to sleep by 14:50, so I cancelled the sleep and decided to go back to my office. I got dressed again and went downstairs. I noticed Flat 4 was cloudy inside. I thought it was sawdust or something, and that the Maintenance Man was working inside. Then I caught a whiff of smoke, which smelled like burning wood or paper. I went inside to investigate.<br><br>The window was smashed and there were books on the 4 hobs of the cooker, which were all set on full power, creating all this smoke. Fortunately it wasn't quite enough to cause flames, at least yet. I switched the hobs off, first thing.<br><br>I realised that the smoke alarms should have been triggered, but I saw that the fire alarm wasn't working. The Arsonist may have disabled it.<br><br>I opened the front door and took a look outside, and saw a flare had been chucked onto the flowers in the garden. It was burning intensely red for a few seconds, and set the surrounding bluebells on fire within about a 6 inch radius. Then it went out and didn't continue. I went and touched it, and it was still hot (I wasn't thinking right at the time, so don't criticise!).<br><br>I knocked on the door of the person next door to the smokey room and showed him the scene. The books were still on the hobs, smoking, so I began to throw them out of the window where they would be less harmful. Then he pointed out that I shouldn't go around touching everything because I've left my fingerprints on them now.<br><br>I called the police and fire brigade. Then I saw some people outside who had witnessed some of the event from the back. They said they had seen him throw the flare and go outside and that he had smashed a car window further on.<br><br>The police and fire brigade came within minutes and put the books out. The police had caught the suspect, whom had been running around stark naked in the road. Unipol came too, and the maintenance man came later. I left at that point, to go back to my office.<br><br>I had breathed quite a bit of that book smoke, so I hoped my lungs weren't affected much.<br><br>Later I did some Yoga practice (in Baines Wing) with Captain Cheery and others. I reminisced about how today's music theme is good.<br><br>Technically, I had saved 4 or 5 lives today. Although, mostly it was up to luck. If I hadn't gone home to sleep, or if I had gone to sleep as I intended, things might have been worse.</p>
