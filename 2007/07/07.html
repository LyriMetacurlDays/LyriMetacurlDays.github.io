        <h1>The Frosty Forest Dream</h1>
        <h2>2007 Lost Day 14</h2>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 7th <a href="../07.html"><u>July 2007</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r65 nc">&nbsp;65&#42;&nbsp;</span> &#42;But actually probably a lot higher, like 78.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Music theme: Frosty Forest (version 1) (TPCi).<br>

        <p class="writing note">Note: Nothing was recorded today, so the rating was lost as well and later smeared over with a <q>65</q> because that was the normal sort of rating these days. Perhaps I will change it in future, but it doesn't really effect the statistics because this was still the best month of 2007 and it was not in the top few days of the month either.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>There was a day which I have calculated to be probably today (most likely) or maybe it was the 14th (2007 Lost Day 21) instead. I and the Emperor were at the Space Ship (having gone there the day before) and we had a normal Night at the Space Ship, in the back room, but the music of Frosty Forest stuck in my head all night. That was the only thing I remembered and later attributed to this missing day. The usual Space Ship routine probably happened too.</p>
