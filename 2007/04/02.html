        <p class="writing">Breakfast: Fruit & Fibre (like nowadays), and a cup of lemonade (7up).<br><br>I found a video that showed someone playing the ‘Shadow the Hedgehog’ level ‘Sky Troops’ very expertly and quickly. I showed it to the Viscount and he got really jealous of it:-</p>

        <p class="writing"><br>The Viscount went on ‘Sky Troops’ and tried to do the neutral mission very fast, but he couldn't and got extremely stressed, yet still determined to keep trying even though he was saying out loud “this is making me really stressed out!!!” and “f██king hell!” and being on the verge of crying.<br><br>When I asked him if I could do it (to beat my own record), he determinedly refused and continued.<br><br>He went to get a drink, and in a demonstration of lack of trust, he took the controller out of the PS2 so that I couldn't go on (even though I respected his try so I wouldn't have gone on).<br><br>He had gotten very quickly to checkpoint 3 with 4 lives, but as a direct result of him taking the control out, I felt offended by his lack of trust and switched the PS2 off. It also felt appropriate to stop the Viscount's extreme stress. My reasoning at the time was “because I wasn't going to go on the PS2 without his permission so there was no reason for him to take the controller out unless he wanted me to switch the PS2 off at the time”. He obviously permanently changed his mind about that once the PS2 was off though.<br><br>I went upstairs to write about this incident and I heard the Viscount say that I was “banned for the day” (from the PS2) and then I heard the sound of the PS2 being smashed up and the ‘Shadow the Hedgehog’ disc being snapped in half (or into pieces).<br><br>Expecting the worst, I went downstairs to check, and the PS2 and ‘Shadow the Hedgehog’ disk were all intact, as if nothing had happened. The controller was plugged in, but the memory card had been taken out (so I couldn't save any progress if I did go on the game).<br><br>The Viscount had taken the memory card out because he wanted to be a “stress bag generator”, but that “stress bag” was of a pathetically small order of magnitude so it had no effect on me. But at least it satisfied him.<br><br>I did some PS2-with-no-memory-cards.<br><br>Confirmed that I will get an ‘After Eight’ Easter egg for Easter.<br><br>Dinner – Cheese on toast with onions and “wuster sauce” (I was in a rush writing this, so I couldn't be bothered writing Worcestershire).<br><br>The Emperor was on ‘Red Alert’ (RA1). He was very stressed. I heard him say “please, god!!” downstairs.<br><br>The background anxiety I had about getting those Sonic games soon (which I had recently ordered) (promised between 3rd and 10th of April 2007) increased a lot throughout the day.<br><br>Descent Chrono levels 3, 4 and half of 5 (in front of the Duke, so he could see how it's done).<br><br>Walk to The Bench.<br><br>The Viscount gave back the memory card. I went on ‘Sky Troops’ neutral mission and got a new family record time of 03:56 instead of 03:58.<br><br>Tea – Fish and chips, with peas.<br><br>The “Disgusting” incident happened. This made me wonder about whether all life forms should be considered “poisonous” from a certain point of view.<br><br>Finished Descent Chrono level 5. Did some of level 6.<br><br>Read the story ‘The Red Egg’, which the Emperor had recommended, from the book ‘The Best of Science Fiction 10’, while listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHgMhd0UcDw" target="_blank"><u>‘Defend the Base’ (Frank Klepacki)</u></a>, which really suited it. The story showed that the magnitude of unimagined events was far greater than even MY imagination.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p class="writing note">Even though the Easter feeling was prevalent, there was also a great sense of foolishness and deprivation (that is what I am supposed to have, enforced by the Overgod).</p>
