        <p class="writing note">Note: This is my last childhood day that has a music theme.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>I kept listening to the music theme &lsquo;Kids in America&rsquo; (LEN) on the headphones inside the tent.<br><br>There's a lower section of Glen Rosa which has a stream which turns into a river when it goes to high flow (maybe with respect to the tide).<br><br>That morning, the river had gone to high flow and flooded someone's tent nearby who had set it up in the river's path. Apparently there was a PS2 in their tent, which was ruined. They were all laughing about nature and her antics.<br><br>We discovered that Glen Rosa was like a midge bowl. There were loads of midges. There were so many midges that we had to keep wiping our faces, like a windscreen wiper, to get them off.<br><br>We decided to leave Glen Rosa as soon as possible.<br><br>The Overgod nearly reversed the car off the edge and into the river section (which had gone back to low flow). We had to push it back onto the upper grass and carefully / slowly drive it.<br><br>We explored more of the Isle of Arran.</p>
