        <h1>The Maretarium</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 10th <a href="../08.html"><u>August 2006</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r98 nc">&nbsp;98&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p class="writing note">Note: The real music theme of the day was a Finnish song on the radio that said the equivalent of “yeah” in it a lot (most likely “niin”, but it could have been “yo” or “kylla”), while we were driving to Eagle Town. It is probably forgotten which exact track it is, unless someone has a record of every song the Finnish radio in Eagle Town was playing on this day and I were to slowly trawl through them. There may be multiple ones that fit the bill, but I haven't found any. One that almost fits is the substitute music theme below, which might as well be the theme for now (until a better substitute is found, if ever).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Substitute music theme: Niin Kaunis on Taivas (Jasmine).<br>

        <p class="writing">I had a dream that there was a special person called Lima.<br><br>The Boss, the Wizard, the Emperor and I went to Eagle Town and parked in a steep parking space that was aimed at the lake (with no fence in the way), such that if the brakes failed, the car would fall in.<br><br>We went to Aino's flat. We were given ‘Fazers’ (packs of sweets with these flavours in: Rex, Orange, Tosca, Krapu, Lakta, Islanti and KissKiss).<br><br>We went to the maretarium (aquarium) and looked at all the fish. One of them we called the “Viscount fish” because it looked stereotypically like the Viscount would be if he was a fish. It was quite curious. It was about the size of a small head, and quite round.<br><br>There was a “water garden” we visited too. Near the Eagle Town square, there was a sort of cliff with an “O-HOY” sign on top. We also visited the giant flak cannon.<br><br>Back at the Boss's Little Brother's house, we had a meal, which was spaghetti Bolognese, but it was what I called, “the really good kind that the Overgoddess doesn't make.”<br><br>Note: Today was the best day of the Finland trip because the best Eagle Town adventures happened today. I can't seem to capture how good it was with words. Today got rated 98, which was the new number one best day on record, beating ‘Drok’ into second place.</p>
