        <p class="writing"><br>We left Eagle Town.<br><br>The Boss's Brother took us West across Finland, to Tikkurila. He put &lsquo;Down By The Riverside&rsquo; (Louis Armstrong) and other similar music tracks on at the time.<br><br>The head-rest at the back of my seat was made too high and I tried to get it down for a lot of the journey but the Emperor kept saying I was like I was <q>trying to defuse a bomb</q>.<br><br>The Boss's Brother left back for Eagle Town and the rest of us all went in a train to Helsinki to explore the city.<br><br>We went in two churches.<br><br>We had dinner in a place with market roofs (and Mexican music apparently).<br><br>We all went via boat to Suomenlinna, where I and the Emperor looked inside the submarine there that had been turned into a museum.<br><br>We all went on a tram tour of Helsinki.<br><br>We each had a <q>mega hamburger</q> in a burger-bar / restaurant (fast food).<br><br>We went (on the train) back to Tikkurila and slept there. I and the Emperor were in one room in the hotel, and the Boss and Wizard were in another room. We were going to get up early tomorrow morning for the flight.<br><br>That night, I took some famous photos of the Emperor looking fanatical.</p>
