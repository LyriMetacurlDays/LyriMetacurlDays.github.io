        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 30th <a href="../09.html"><u>September 2025</u></a></p>

        <p>Music theme: Trash Can Song (No Dubstep version) (The Chalkeaters).<br>

        <p class="writing">Sleep. Some Internet between about 01:30 and 03:00.<br><br>Got up a little early. Had a little rest. Went to the Peach Bark around 11:20.<br><br>I and the Overgoddess went shopping afterwards, to buy another round of clothes, since the one from April 2025 wasn't sufficient.<br><br>Lunch and some Laptop. I finally updated version 3 of the diary since August 2024, with pages of the months up to this month. I was amazed that I had decided today will be the representative day though and forced it to have the theme. The alternative would have been to make the 2nd of February 2025 be the representative. Though I thought that will probably have to be the Deputy Representative now.<br><br><span class="note">Note: Later I decided that the one with 'In Your Room' should be the real Deputy Representative since that also stuck in my head and I thought it should win too but today won because it was essentially 2 days against 1 and this day had the better version of 'Trash Can Song' in my opinion.</span><br><br>Tea: Filet Mignon steak, chips, and the 1969 bottle of wine. The cork broke apart and it had to be filtered, but it turned out good in the end. That was perhaps one of the more expensive meals I've ever had (but not as expensive as that big one from 2015).<br><br>Some Anglo-Saxon archaeology was on TV that night (downstairs existence). Usual tea. Showered at the end of the day.</p>
