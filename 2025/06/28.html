        <p class="writing"><br>Sleep. I thought I was thinking too much, which was reducing my sleep, so I invented <q>antithoughts</q> to cancel it out. The concept of an antithought is actually a thought itself. It is just a thought that directly counters the distressing or disruptive (or as the paper diary says, <q>distruptive</q>) thoughts from being allowed to exist.<br><br>That afternoon, I went to Liverpool (on the train) and had a wander around and went to Tortilla for a tortilla. I was <q>coerced</q> into buying some <q>crisps</q> (which were more like nachos or Doritos) with it, but that was fine anyway.<br><br>Went to the &lsquo;The Devout&rsquo; gig afterwards, in Liverpool O2 Arena, about 7 to 11pm. They started off playing some Depeche Mode songs I didn't know (probably including &lsquo;A Question Of Lust&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Question Of Time&rsquo;), but I think they also did &lsquo;Walking In My Shoes&rsquo;, &lsquo;In Your Room&rsquo; and &lsquo;Halo&rsquo;. Then they moved on to their most popular ones (&lsquo;Personal Jesus&rsquo; and &lsquo;Just Can't Get Enough&rsquo;) and then their best ones (&lsquo;Enjoy the Silence&rsquo; and &lsquo;Never Let Me Down Again&rsquo;, which may or may not have been the encore, if they had an encore). I think they didn't play &lsquo;Strangelove&rsquo; or &lsquo;Useless&rsquo;.<br><br>I went for the last train back. It had an unknown delay time, due to apparently someone being hit by a train along the way, but they said it would cause more disruption if it was on the way to Preston. Some girls from Preston came up to me and the blonde one offered me some crackers. Although my mouth was dry, which I told them, I slowly ate one anyway and made friends with that group of girls (really easily, as I expect). On the train, a couple of seats had been sicked on by various drunkards in the train's previous journey and had not been cleaned. The group of girls sat on one table with a sicked seat free, so I just stood up. Though later all of them decided to squeeze in to one side and let me sit on the free part next to the sick. Some people in a next table later then tried to insinuate that I had been the one that had done the sick, but I treated it as a joke, and the girls knew it wasn't me either. I got off first (at Overheaven) while they went to Preston but they presumably faced delays due to that train hit.<br><br>I walked back to Hgwrtz, listening to some Depeche mode tracks (mostly today's theme and subtheme).</p>
