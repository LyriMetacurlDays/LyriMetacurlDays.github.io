    <p class="writing">For the first two hours of the day, I and the Viscount watched episodes 11 to 14 of &lsquo;Attack on Titan&rsquo;. We decided we wouldn't go for a walk because it had gotten late.<br><br>We came to the conclusion that <q>I had won.</q> In general.<br><br>Then I walked to the New Office. On the way it was a bit windy and I felt like I could fly. There was a competition in my mind over which day should win the prize for being the second most legendary day of 2015, out of &lsquo;Fip&rsquo; or &lsquo;Wife Man Beast Man Pearl&rsquo;. They were both serious contenders.<br><br>The combination of all these factors felt like mild overperfection (despite being single). Not ecstasy but really awesome and happy. I posted a Facebook status about this.<br><br>I went to the New Office. On the way, I walked past the Faversham and the bouncer tried to tell me that I couldn't go through that way because the gate is closed this time. However, I just said <q>it doesn't matter.</q> He let me walk on. When I got to the closed gate, I just went over the climbable bit of wall next to it, like I usually do when that gate is closed (this was probably about the third time it has been closed when I've tried to go through since I first moved in to the New Office in late 2015, but the other times weren't worth mentioning).<br><br>At the New Office, I discovered today's theme song (&lsquo;Rox&rsquo; by The Aliens). I probably broke the record of how quickly a music track can grow on me and downloaded it immediately, also putting it as my current #1 best track. Also I discovered the subtheme (a video of &lsquo;Elevate&rsquo; by Electrode &amp; Frank Royal which cuts off the last word (<q>long</q>), so it seems to suddenly end on the phrase <q>all night-</q>).<br><br>Then I went home listening to the theme song (&lsquo;Rox&rsquo;).<br><br>I had a nice, long sleep, from about 04:30.<br><br>I briefly woke up in the morning, about 9AM, then went back to sleep again and had a dream involving titans and humans going down a long vertical passage to a main reactor. There were two separate staircases, a large circular spiral staircase for titans and a small square spiral staircase for humans.<br><br>There were three settings on the reactor, one was red (explode), one was green (nothing?) and one was blue (something?). I forgot the specific details of what the reactor settings did or who wanted which setting, but the dream was very tense. The <q>good</q> outcome happened in the end.<br><br>I woke up at about 11:30.<br><br>Gradual preparation (drawn out). Coffee. Veg smoothie. Avocado. Fruit smoothie (including a blended avocado seed).<br><br>The Viscount texted me asking if I was coming over yet, and I realised I was late. I said I'm on my way, then ran to his place while listening to the subtheme (the aforementioned version of &lsquo;Elevate&rsquo; by Electrode &amp; Frank Royal).<br><br>I got to the Viscount's place at about 17:20. He made some Makeshift Sausage Soup for us.<br><br>We finished watching all the remaining episodes of &lsquo;Attack on Titan&rsquo; (episodes 15 to 25).<br><br>We also reminisced about an old in-joke, where when you are with people in a room and someone leaves for a while, when they come back in the room and everyone turns to look, you loudly whisper <q>spack</q> with a slightly anxious expression. This originted from the movie of &lsquo;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&rsquo;, when the Minister said <q>he's back</q> and it sounded like <q>spack</q>.<br><br>Then we went for a walk around Woodhouse Moor, then up the road to see the first Otley Run pubs (Woodies, the Three Horseshoes, the New Inn, Arcadia, the Arc, Headingley Taps, the Box, the Skyrack and the Original Oak). We also checked the Viscount's next accommodation.<br><br>We walked up the hill to the place where the newly sold <q>old Scientology building</q> (old girls' school) was, said our goodbyes and headed back to our respective homes.</p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today's rating was 101 officially, making it the second day ever to get an overperfect rating. This carried with it a very high chance of today being the best day of 2016, unless something really AMAZING happens or if I get even better at mastering overperfection.</p>
