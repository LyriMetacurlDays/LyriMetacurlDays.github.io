        <p class="writing note">Note: I consider there to be two different versions of &lsquo;Scraparap&rsquo;, even if there aren't supposed to be officially. So this is technically the actual <q>theme of the day</q> if it is what I call the Distinct version (as it is in the above video link currently). The Indistinct version (the one used for &lsquo;My Earthday 2016&rsquo;) starts off more balanced between the ears (even though both versions can still be classed as <q>stereo</q> rather than <q>mono</q>, because different instruments are in different ears) and the Distinct version distinctly starts in one ear until the other instruments come on. The difference is extremely clear between these two versions if you hear multiple videos of the song (for example on YouTube).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Finished the socialising at Hyde Park Book Club.<br><br>Went back to 8th Headquarters and went to sleep.<br><br>Got up at about 9am.<br><br>Usual morning stuff.<br><br>I found out about a &lsquo;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&rsquo; custom mission called &lsquo;Queen of Board&rsquo;, which apparently has a very long and <q>frustrating</q> first level called &lsquo;Queen of B&nbsp;o&nbsp;a&nbsp;r&nbsp;D&lsquo;, which is apparently a <q>mythic</q> level. I also heard that the in-game instructions in that level are <q>all true except one</q>, compared to most levels which apparently say <q>go here</q> and then say, <q>hahaha, sucker&#33;</q> or something, leading you to a hard place.<br><br>On the Internet, I could find no maps of the maze and no walkthroughs of it&#33; So I thought it could be a good idea for someone to make a walkthrough of it, and maybe they would get loads of views.<br><br>I re-downloaded &lsquo;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&#58; The Secret Files&rsquo; and put &lsquo;Queen of Board&rsquo; on it as well, then tried it. The background was a bit like the &lsquo;Quake&rsquo; clouds, but coming at you at 90 degrees from the actual &lsquo;Quake&rsquo; clouds. I could not save at first because it said there was no memory. After a bit of exploring, it said I should do the &lsquo;Crystal Caves of T'sar&rsquo; or something.<br><br>I didn't feel bored today, by the way, as today's title might imply. Unlike some days ago.<br><br>I noticed that I had a vision error, which I had never had before - a chunk of my central sight was replaced by a malfunctiony jagged pattern, like extreme razzle dazzle. I got worried that this might be to do with the Lymecycline, and that it could be permanent.<br><br>Had a rest from about 12:00 to 13:45. The vision error went away. I could tell it had gone, because, when I had it, it was really obvious and scary. And right now, it was not.<br><br>I looked at the &lsquo;Queen of B&nbsp;o&nbsp;a&nbsp;r&nbsp;D&rsquo; level on JC2.exe and found where the <q>trigger point</q> is. A place that is really hard to get to and frustrating to get out of, although I had successfully achieved getting out of it twice (albeit only with Jazz but never with Lori, despite trying to get out of there more with Lori).<br><br>I did &lsquo;Learn Python In One Day And Learn It Well&rsquo; chapter 5.<br><br>Tried &lsquo;Queen of B&nbsp;o&nbsp;a&nbsp;r&nbsp;D&rsquo; again, did the really hard bit, but found that there is an actual impossible bit in the caves, where you cannot jump high enough. So I angrily deleted all the files including the entire &lsquo;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&rsquo; directory again.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: One and a half months in the future, someone did upload a walkthrough of it, showing that it is not impossible if you play as Spaz (not Jazz or Lori, as I had been doing)&#58;</p>

        <p class="writing"><br>Made spaghetti bolognaise.<br><br>Finished reading chapter 4 of &lsquo;Antifragile&rsquo;.<br><br>Created YouTube playlist of April 2016. Yesterday's theme song could not be found at the time, and I also omitted the theme for &lsquo;Mill Hill Chapill&rsquo; so that it wouldn't ruin the playlist.<br><br>Put the laundry in the washing machine.<br><br>Set alarm for tomorrow.<br><br>Went to bed and sleep.</p>
