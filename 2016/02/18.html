    <p class="writing note">Note: It's interesting that the original YouTube link to the theme song had all capital letters (and numbers) in its URL (watch?v=ALBKFB28E0M). The odds of that are probably very low.</p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Quote of the Day: <q>Apparently, awkwardness and shyness are actually the worst crimes ever, and people punish them with a fate worse than death - extinction.</q> &mdash; Me.</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>Initial thoughts aboout the Creepy (Zombie) Incident: It is very relevant about the little things. Such as one of the postgrads' posts on <q>sapiosexuals</q> and another's quip about <q>having been a martial artist</q> when people were talking about men groping women then getting whacked. If these pre-situations were not mentioned, my subsequent comments would be seen as having been <q>out of the blue</q> and thus weird. With these pre-situations, it is obviously communication of the normal kind.<br><br>Sleep approximately 00:30 to 05:30.<br><br>Updated some diary stories (3rd to 10th November 2008) on MS Word.<br><br>Coffee and shower.<br><br>I wished the Queen of Awesome and the Queen of Awesomeness happy birthdays (it's a sheer coincidence that they have the same birthday).<br><br>Had a shower (while listening to &lsquo;An Ocean In Between The Waves&rsquo; by The War on Drugs, which is rare for these days, but was to commemorate the Queen of Awesome's birthday).<br><br>Got dressed and checked everything. Left the house a little late (I had told Pe$ha I would be late).<br><br>I got to Door 2.12 (in the Building) by about 09:40. Helped Pe$ha there until about 11:30. I was also asked for help by some other students who happened to be there at the time, so I had no choice but to oblige. However, today I had nothing else to do, so there was no pressure at all. During this time, Pe$ha gave me some food and coffee. I realised that I had not put the newly written up diary entries on the pen drive (they were left at home).<br><br>Went to the New Office. I felt since nothing was on today, and helping Pe$ha had counted as my "socialising" for the day, considering yesterday's scare, and it wasn't even 12:00 yet, I now had LOADS AND LOADS of free time. I decided that since tomorrow is fully booked, that day can be called &lsquo;Time Poverty&rsquo; and today has to have the opposite word to &lsquo;poverty&rsquo;. I looked on thesaurus.com and found the closest antonym I could found, which was &lsquo;affluence&rsquo;. It suited it, I thought. Tomorrow, I changed it to &lsquo;richness&rsquo; after a further assessment, but today, on the day, it was known as &lsquo;Time Affluence&rsquo;.<br><br>I decided to write up the memos I had kept in my phone and continue backtracking 2014 entries.<br><br>Apparently the only Quake 2 music tracks that I hadn't used were &lsquo;Showdown&rsquo; and &lsquo;Descent Into Cerberon&rsquo;.<br><br>I was organising more phone memos and didn't know where to put the one where the Queen of Awesome had shown me the song &lsquo;Ocean&rsquo; (Dead Can Dance), so I decided to just mention it here in this paragraph.<br><br>I continued organising more phone memes.</p>
