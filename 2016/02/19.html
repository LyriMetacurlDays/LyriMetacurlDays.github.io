    <p class="writing">Today's weather: Sunny.</p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Note: As anticipated, today was like the complete opposite of yesterday. Except for the ominous presence of the zombie from mid-2012, and still having FPS Syndrome against it.</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>00:00 to 01:00 - the day started at the New Office. I felt the time pressure increase immensely because I needed to get sleep. I couldn't record today's theme, but managed a low quality one on my phone, through the sound of my headphones playing it.<br><br>01:00 to 01:30 - Went home to 8th Headquarters. Set the alarm for six hours in the future.<br><br>01:30 to 07:30 - Sleep.<br><br>Actually, sleep was 02:30 and that I set an alarm for 08:30. I also put an eye cover on (1 strip).<br><br>I had a dream, but forgot what it was about, other than that it had people in it.<br><br>I woke up and panicked about being late, since there had been no alarm, but then realised it was 08:29&#33; Then the alarm went off at 08:30.<br><br>08:45 coffee and 09:00 shower.<br><br>09:00 to 09:30 - In the shower, I listened my low quality recording of 'Zombie Defence Agency Menu' (Miniclip). Of course it finished way before I had finished washing myself.<br><br>09:30 to 09:40 - Dressed and prepared to go.<br><br>09:40 to 10:00 - While walking on the way to the Building, I listened 'Vocal (Album version)' (Pet Shop Boys) and was thinking of the day 'Touch is a Must' (which I hadn't put online yet). Today, Valerie became my number 1 again, partly because of memories and partly because she is one of only two prospective women who are there when no one else is (the other one is the Woman).<br><br>10:00 to 13:00 - Demonstration (PEME5320 Group 4, Problem 2).<br><br>I went to the toiled about 14:00, and in there I saw a notice that said:-<br><br>┌──────────┐<br>│&nbsp;DO NOT REMOVE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│<br>│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOILET ROLLS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│<br>│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THANKS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│<br>│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>CLEA&nbsp;&nbsp;NING</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│<br>│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>SUPERVISION</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│<br>└──────────┘<br><br>At first, I thought it was by someone called Clea Ning, but then I realised it was just 'cleaning'.<br><br>13:00 to 14:00 - Lunch hour in Café Maia.<br><br>I talked to Figuer about the New Creepy Incident (the zombie from mid-2012) and how maybe my awkwardness causes these incidents.<br><br>I was going to go for the meal deal, but then realised the water and crisps were not needed. So I just had the panini and the overall price was cheaper by about £1.25. I also got a Grande Americano.<br><br>Pablo waited with me for my panini to be made before we both joined Figuer at the table.<br><br>Figuer inquired about the the large size of my coffee cup and realised that Café Maia now has a Grande Americano option, which she would like. I said I had only discovered it recently too (I think it was within the past few months but this was maybe the first or second time I ever bought a Grande Americano here, rather than a Large Americano which both I and Figuer usually have).<br><br>The three of us were also talking about Mexican food, and I said it would be a good idea to carry around a bottle of Tabasco cause. Figuer said she used to carry one around but she doesn't any more. I thought this was funny because it seemed like a stereotypical Mexican thing to do.<br><br>I told Figuer that I had had a relationship with Valerie (in 2013), and, to my surprise, she hadn't known. She commended me. She also said I shouldn't worry about the New Creepy Incident because of this.<br><br>I, Figuer and Pablo all hoped that there would be less people at the last demonstrating session...<br><br>14:00 to 17:00 - Demonstration (PEME5320 Group 4, Problem 2). It turned out there were more people in this session, so it took the full time.<br><br>17:00 to 18:00 - I corrected the thesis (version 4) to make version 5 (or 5.1 for now). If there are other tiny things to correct, it will be more of version 5.<br><br>18:00 to 18:40 - Sent the new version of the thesis to the Internal, as well as Brains and Dravus, with an explanation of changes. Updated the online diary blog a little.<br><br>18:40 to 19:00 - Went to Global Tribe Café. On the way, in town, at about 18:50, I switched my phone on (which had not been on since 14:00) and saw that the Queen of Awesome had messaged me (on normal text) saying she has just fallen out with a friend and needs a friend, and had asked me if I'm free tonight.<br><br>I texted her (also on normal text) that I have only just switched my phone on and that I'm going to Global Tribe Café, which she is invited to.<br><br>19:00 to 22:00 - I was at Global Tribe Café. I messaged the Queen of Awesome on Whatsapp that she is invited, although Global Tribe Café is officially closed. She did receive and read this, however, the Queen of Awesome did not reply at all today. I didn't bother inquiring why, though, and decided to leave it up to her to send the next message ever.<br><br>The Iridologist, the Mack and another woman were there first.<br><br>The Iridologist made a raw / life-food cake in front of us. The "icing" was macadamia nut paste which she made from macadamaia nuts.<br><br>The 'Molecules of emotion' book was suggested by the Mack. He is interested in mental health.<br><br>The Iridologist was certain and adamant that all of my problems (such as the resurrection of the zombie) have definitely come from not doing Doctor Jubb's liver / gallbladder cleanses. When I said "could be", from my point of view, at least I was considering the possibility that she was right, and keeping an open mind, but the Iridologist seemed frustrated that I was not absolutely certain that she was right.<br><br>I then decided to do some research of my own and looked up "Iridology" on Wikipedia. It said that iridology is widely believed to be a pseudoscience because "the iris is one of the most stable features of the human body and can be used for identification" and because a test had been done to see if three iridologists could diagnose kidney disorders in patients and they had failed.<br><br>I also looked up liver-gallbladder cleanses on the Internet, and it said they are fake and that the stuff to drink creates the stones in your gut, and that they are not real gallstones (which are far more brittle and often harder). It also says the gallbladder could contract hard enough to expel some stones if one were to eat fried fish and chips or a load of milk and a Mars bar (in other words, some fatty and downright unhealthy food).<br><br>Two more women and Kap came later on. We all had more conversations.<br><br>I said goodbye to Kap, the Mack and the Iridologist.<br><br>19:45 to 22:05 - As I was walking home, I accepted my social awkwardness and felt happy about it.<br><br>At first, I went to McDonald's and ordered a spicy mayo Chicken Legend, mozzarella sticks and large fries, so that I could try a real "liver purge".<br><br>22:05 to 23:00 - I walked back to 8th Headquarters, hoping to do more November 2008 diary entries, but instead, when I got there, I just contemplated stuff (such as the resurrected zombie) for about 40 minutes. decided I wasn't going to be productive in the last part of the day, so I just went to bed, setting my alarm for 06:50 tomorrow (so that I would have enough time for five sleep cycles).<br><br>23:00 onwards: Sleep.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Zombie Denial(ism)?</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>Why am I not allowed to socially interact? I need to socially interact, that is a fundamental need. Is it because I'm awkward? Since when did awkwardness become a bad thing? It's innocent behaviour.<br><br>To Hilla (if she is indeed the one who dug up the zombie) - <q>last time I looked, it said 'r'.</q><br><br>This refers to the term <q>friend</q> on Facebook - there is an <q>r</q> in it, right? I am sure it doesn't say <q>fiend</q>.</p>
