        <p class="writing">I woke up at 07:30 (from the alarm) and had the next Lymecycline tablet at about 07:40.<br><br>I had a little extra rest, and had a brilliant idea. I would create a different account with which to collect my income from the postdoc&#33;<br><br>I ironed my black jeans and dry-shaved. Then I remembered that yesterday, Amazon had said my new hair buzzer was <q>out for delivery</q>, so it should have been delivered&#33;<br><br>I went on Amazon and discovered, to my disappointment, that the mysterious doorbell ring I had heard yesterday evening from the German's flat had been Amazon trying to deliver my shaving equipment&#33; They had completely neglected to RING OTHER DOORBELLS&#33; I thought this was incredibly stupid of them, especially since last year when they should have learned that as a whole.<br><br>However, they weren't specifically instructed to ring other doorbells, so they simply rang my flat during a specific time when I wasn't in that particular room, and then decided to give up straight away&#33;&#33;<br><br>I changed my delivery instructions, but they didn't have an option to put <q>RING OTHER DOORBELLS&#33;</q> so I entered it into the <q>deliver to a neighbour</q> option - the <q>who?</q> box was <q>other people in the house</q> and the second box, which said something like <q>where</q>, I put <q>Ring other doorbells&#33;</q> (non-capitalised, but still with an exclamation mark). I also changed today's title to be &lsquo;Amazon's Incompetence&rsquo;, hopefully temporarily, but if they somehow fail to deliver again today, then the title will stick.<br><br>Had coffee and breakfast (finished the Jersey milk off). Had shower. Got dressed.<br><br>[more stuff in between]<br><br>Amazon successfully delivered their package, so the title was no longer &lsquo;Amazon's Incompetence&rsquo;.<br><br>I went to Captain Cheery's house and had dinner there (butternut squash mixture).<br><br>Then we both went to Hyde Park Book Club for the &lsquo;Elemental&rsquo; art exhibition.</p>
