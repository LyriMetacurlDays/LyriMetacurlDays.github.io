        <p class="writing">I ironed my clothes and prepared for the interview today.<br><br>I had a massive accidental loss (or so I thought at the time, but in hindsight it had actually been irretrievable since April 2016).<br><br>Now was time for the actual real thing. That is, the thing which had been cancelled on &lsquo;The Real Thing&rsquo; (11 days ago).<br><br>I drove to the Hive. I missed the final turn at first, because the sign for the Hive just said what it was, not the name of the company. I turned around and went in successfully though. Got in fine. Went to the reception. There, I found out that it wasn't an interview, just a document check. I am told to look out for an email to the next stage (induction session), which will have limited spaces, so I have to look out for it quickly.<br><br>Then I drove back - this is the hardest route back, by myself again. The contorted <q>roundabout</q> at Junction 31 of the M62 (which I named &lsquo;the Spidabout&rsquo;) had loads of lanes that were confusing, but there was not much traffic, so I managed to find the correct exit first time. On the M621, I turned off one stop too early, which was more like on the way towards DC's place. But I let the SatNav talking give me directions all the way back, which was successful.<br><br>I wonder what the black box will have to say about my trips today. I have to wait a day or two for that.<br><br><span class="note">Note from the future: the black box said my driving was Gold standard (top form).</span><br><br>I had a bit of a rest, and an intense think about how things are going these days. I hope I get this job.<br><br>I realised that Instrumental &#64; Inkwell &#35;46 was on today, so I officially indicated that I would go to it.<br><br>I used up the last of the sourdough bread (which, by this time, was rock hard) in making a few quick butties.<br><br>I discovered today's music theme, which really suits today.<br><br>Walked to Inkwell (45 minutes) while listening to today's theme on repeat. I wondered what today's bad guys (such as CurseD and the Satanist) would have thought if they knew I was walking with that music on. Probably not something they could possibly imagine, because they think I'm so not cool.<br><br>I had three pints of Ridgeside Cascadia this time (my second-favourite beer).<br><br>The last (highlight) band was written down as &lsquo;Black Sox&rsquo; on Dave's list, but presented as &lsquo;Blacksocks&rsquo; on their live transmission (YouTube and/or Facebook Live&#63; Which I hadn't seen done before). So I decided to combine the two and say it's spelt &lsquo;BlackSocks&rsquo;. Maybe it's supposed to have a space bar in between. If I find out the truth, I'll delete this sentence and modify this text.<br><br>During BlackSocks's gig, there was a call for last orders at the bar. Then, after another one of their songs, there was another one, called the <q>final last orders</q> or <q>last last orders</q>. After their next song, the bar did a bell. We didn't know whether that was <q>actual final last orders</q> or <q>time at the bar</q> (meaning they have stopped serving now).<br><br>During packing-up time, Dave went into the Staff Only door, mentioning that Inkwell has a downstairs, and I followed him, out of pure curiosity. I saw that there is an elaborate basement, which another staff member (who told me to get out) said is just as big as the ground floor! So there is a lot more space in that building than the impression it gives.<br><br>Dave helped pack up the Instrumental stuff more, and then we went to the Three Hulats and took a taxi home.</p>
