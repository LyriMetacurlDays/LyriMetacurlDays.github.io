        <p class="writing">Sleep.<br><br>Coffee.<br><br>C Chapter 1.7.<br><br>Showered and got dressed.<br><br>Breakfast at about 1pm.<br><br>I found that the University was closed for Easter and no one had replied to my emails. So it will have to wait.<br><br>Also, I have to leave on the day the University re-opens, so if there is anything wrong with my thesis submission, the deadlines will have passed. However, submitting it all yesterday as maximally as possible counts as meeting the deadline, in my world. So I don't have to worry at all. If anyone blames me, I will just point out the incompetence of the people involved as the cause of 100% of the problems encountered.<br><br>I tried to join the <q>tetration forum</q> and sent a registration request.<br><br>I realised I had forgotten three times in a row to print the holiday ticket on mobileprint, so I thought I would have to go to the 24-hour cluster to print it. I sent it on mobileprint one last time first, to see if it goes through.<br><br>I thought &lsquo;It's Always Too Late to Start Over&rsquo; (Chris Zabriskie) was one of the most depressing songs ever and &lsquo;Apelle Mon Numéro&rsquo; (Mylène Farmer) was one of the most <q>opposite of depressing</q> (uplifting?) songs ever.<br><br>I went to check the ticket, and mobileprint had been successful. Also, the previous two attempts were still there (though the original one had been deleted). I printed one copy off and deleted the others.<br><br>I found out about the &lsquo;Tay&rsquo; AI which Microsoft had experimented with. They had had to delete it within 24 hours because it apparently got trolled. However, I thought, maybe a self-aware artificial general intelligence that could read the entire Internet would turn out like that? Or maybe it would come across my blog and decide that that is the best thing.<br><br>Based on a subsequent suggestion from Facebook, I discovered <q>WaitButWhy</q>'s two-part article on AI. Links:-<br><u>http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html</u><br><u>http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html</u><br><br>I thought, my brain would be the best thing to emulate (as long as there was a non-destructive way of scanning it) because it would be a great leader.<br><br>Went to Tesco to buy a sandwich. There weren't any. Went to Old Morrisons instead and bought some food and drink. Had it.<br><br>I saw that there is also nothing scheduled tomorrow, so I can do whatever I want until 26th March!! Yes!!<br><br>I read the rest of the AI article. It took hours and hours. It took the rest of the day.<br><br>I stayed in the New Office beyond midnight.</p>
