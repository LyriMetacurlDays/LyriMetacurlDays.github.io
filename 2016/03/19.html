        <p class="writing note">Note: I felt ill all day (in my thyroid region especially, and my tonsils, with some coughing and blocked nose) but at least I felt better than yesterday.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Heating.<br><br>I solved C exercise 1.13 (from chapter 1.6).<br><br>Coffee and 100% workout.<br><br>I copied the vertical solution from the Internet. Condensed it.<br><br>Shower. Makeshift veg soup.<br><br>Updated diary and record. Remembered Corin (music creator I discovered in 2011). I did the star prizes for 2015 (Fip was officially given the 2nd Most Legendary Prize).<br><br>Co-op - Cucumber, rice milk, Pears shower gel and liquid honey.<br><br>I went to the New Office with the 'A Year of Living Consciously' book, to update the quotes of the days in 2015 online and also to check for driving test dates.<br><br>At the New Office, the driving test booking website told me I had logged on too many times and had to do a robot-check. However, I could still look for earlier bookings. One of them appeared right adjacent to (and just before) my current one. However, I didn't bother to switch to that one.<br><br>I found this video of 'Rock Bottom' (Eminem) describing the Spongebob episode 'Rock Bottom'.
YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=281IPT4Yonk" target="_blank"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=281IPT4Yonk</u></a><br><br>I added quotes from the 'A Year of Living Consciously' book to some of the online blog entries. Working back, from 4th October 2015 to 1st September 2015.<br><br>By then, it was 7pm, so the After Glow event was supposed to start.<br><br>I found this video from 1984 about "how to send an email".<br>
YouTube Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdbKz5CyhA" target="_blank"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdbKz5CyhA</u></a><br><br>Before I knew it, it was 8pm and I was still in the New Office! Captain Cheery texted asking me where I was.<br><br>I went to the After Glow event - while listening to today's theme song of course&#33; I cut right through the centre of Hyde-Park-In-The-Dark on the way (which I hadn't been through for ages, probably since Bonfire Night 2014 which doesn't even count).<br><br>At the event, I had some vegan sushi (which tasted really good and sushi-like) and a veggie burger with some raw hummus (all really good&#33;). Santino did a rap.<br><br>During the dancing part, DJ Matt put on many songs, including &lsquo;Praise&rsquo; (Art of Tones) at some point, and &lsquo;Incoming&rsquo; (Motorcitysoul Mix) (David K) at the end.<br><br>I helped bring the table and chairs back in.<br><br>I went back to 8th Headquarters.</p>
