        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 12th <a href="../03.html"><u>March 2016</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r78 nc">&nbsp;78&nbsp;</span> (Better).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Music theme: Strong (Robbie Williams).<br>

        <p class="writing">Coffee and breakfast (finished off the last of the Crunchy Nut).<br><br>100% Workout (when I did the triceps one, I was listening to &lsquo;Strong&rsquo; by Robbie Williams). I saw that the theme had not been used yet, so I made it today's theme.<br><br>Went to LUU Essentials and bought a pasty and a sandwich.<br><br>Went to the New Office.<br><br>Dinner: Peruvian avocado, taramasalata, chicken &amp; stuffing butty and a chicken &amp; mushroom slice. Also had some 'yogi tea' choco tea with it. The motto on it said, <q>Love is life. Life is love.</q><br><br>I later had some &lsquo;yogi tea&rsquo; detox tea. This one said, <q>Live in your strength.</q><br><br>I updated some recent diary entries first, which took until about 7pm. I also unsubscribed from Babbel, since I realised I wasn't using it after all.<br><br>I finished all the name adjustments by 21:42. Then I did some of the main adjustments, and decided they were satisfactory. I made the blog public.<br><br>After the last few tweaks, it was nearly midnight, so I headed back to 8th Headquarters.</p>
