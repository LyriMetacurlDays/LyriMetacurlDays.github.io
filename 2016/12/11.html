On the way, I noticed that the petrol was low but didn't have time to refill.<br><br>At the Hive, I had to do a lot of packing correction, and other corrections, which I told a manager about, so I'm not sure if there were any undetected mistakes which my packing partner had done.<br><br>On the way back, the petrol indicator hit 1/6 (the last bit because it only displays sixths) and was flashing and beeping on the way back. I had faith that I would have enough to get back. I went to the petrol station on the way back, successfully.<br><br>It reminded me of the proverbial rat race - needing to work so you can pay for the car / petrol, so you can go to work (hamster wheel).

        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: The counterpart of today is ‘The Verge of Lightness’. There are many coincidences between these days, such as that both days were the representative of the month and both have a next month representative that is the deputy representative of a year. Also, both are next to a day that mentions dancing.</p>
