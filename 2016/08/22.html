        <p class="writing">Got up at 06:30 due to alarms.<br><br>Had a bath.<br><br>Ironed my suit clothes.<br><br>The trousers were too tight, so I would just have to have my black jeans instead.<br><br>Got the documents and everything ready for today's interview.<br><br>Had breakfast and a cup of tea.<br><br>From about 10am, I drove to Leeds (with the Overgod in the back of the car this time). It was very rainy, and on part of the way, there was a variable speed limit part. On one of the places, the electronic sign said 50 mph, then changed suddenly to 40 mph and I didn't have time to slow down (thus going over the measurement lines at 45 mph), so I was worried it will make me go on a Speed Awareness Course.<br><br>At 8th Headquarters, the weather was exactly the same as it was on this day last year (the best day of my life so far), creating that blissful summer rain effect.<br><br>We had a cup of tea each and opened the UHT milk (reserve). We had a little discussion, practised interview questions and talked about life. About how some people on their death beds regret not doing some things, and some just enjoy watching the rain on the leaves.<br><br>We drove to the Hive (in Normanton). This time, the Overgod was in the front passenger seat. We waited at the visitors' entrance. After about ten minutes, someone opened the hatch (which was high up and on the opposite side of the car, so the Overgod answered it).<br><br>We were let in. The Overgod criticised my parking, but he ended up making more mistakes (I'm not saying what).<br><br>Then we went into the reception, and we were told that the meeting had been cancelled. I hadn't checked the emails since yesterday, so I partly blamed myself by (proxy), but later I found out that they had only sent the cancellation email at 10am, so I wouldn't have received it in time regardless of circumstances.<br><br>I drove back to Leeds, and we had another cup of tea. This time, we talked about something related to the Roleplay Effect. When I was consciously aware of it, consciously suppressing it, the Overgod then said it was like I had transformed into a God. Very Zen.<br><br>I drove back to Overheaven after that. It wasn't as rainy this time. The Overgod had a sleep, since he was now very confident in my driving ability.<br><br>Hgwrtz Housing called and asked for the Overgoddess. I said that I'm just a visitor, and he said he would call back and goodbye. Later on, the Overgoddess <q>blamed me because of this call</q>, even though there is nothing to blame about, there is no other way things could have gone, and there is nothing to learn from it.<br><br>I went on a walk to Mt Bump with the Countess, the Overgod and the Overgoddess (who was driving this time). Later in the day, I had a cup of tea and made some &lsquo;England Toasties&rsquo; (so-called because I made a red cross shape with hot pepper sauce). They seemed really spicy, despite me being sparing with the hot pepper sauce this time!! Maybe the Hot Pepper Sauce they have there actually increases sensitivity to Hot Pepper Sauce. In a runaway style. Though this would mean less Hot Pepper Sauce is required every time to have the same effect, which is good, right? (Not when the amount required is too small to practically apply).</p>
