        <p class="writing note">Note: Today's title and tomorrow's title (‘The Real Thing’) were both decided today. They are both based on similar titles for some previous days you might know - ‘The Invisible Thing’ and ‘The Important Thing’.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>Morning preparation.<br><br>I drove (with the Overgod) to Leeds, stopped there for a cup of tea, then drove to Wakefield (past the depot), turned around, and drove from there to Leeds (missed the correct motorway turn, so we went an alternative route), and from Leeds back to Overheaven. Overall, considering all factors (for example, low experience), this was probably the single hardest car journey in my life.<br><br>I read through the terms and conditions for the job in the Hive.<br><br>I drove the Overgod, the Overgoddess and the Countess to Mt Bump. We had a walk there.<br><br>Then I drove them back to Overheaven.<br><br>The Emperor paid a visit. He said that he had recently had a surreal experience when resting, where his hairs stood on end and he felt there was an evil presence, and that his cover felt like it was being dragged off slowly, even though it wasn't moving. We thought maybe he had an “out of soul” experience, and that he was feeling the presence of his own soul.<br><br>Also, we had a discussion with the Duke and the Baroness, in which we mentioned the organ known as the “soul box”, as well as the concept I and the Emperor had invented years ago where we have a "central brain cell" which contains our consciousness, which has blood supplied via the “primary capillary”.<br><br>That night, I read the Hive job booklet. I found some mistakes in there. One of them said to “wear suitable footwork”, and the other one was that it said there are six security essential points, then gave seven separate bullet points about security.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Note - A New Invention of Mine</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* The third quarter of the day was what I called the “Peak of Yang”. This does a full yin-yang cycle every two years (730.5 days) and resets every leap year. On even years, it's the “Peak of Yang”, and on odd years it's the “Peak of Yin” (these are really extreme times, for example, the second quarter of ‘An Overperfect Day’ and the last quarter of ‘The Evil Evening’).</p>
