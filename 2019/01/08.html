    <p class="writing">Today at Work there was more pressure than ever before, since Vaporon didn't have much better to do than to virtually “do my work” while I watched (and helped). I was not in trouble, it was just that he was extremely interested in getting this thing to work. I actually did some of the work too (about half of the time) (that was the part when stuff actually got done, hahaha). But it felt like I was under extreme pressure so I had to take breaks and de-stress whenever I could.</p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Note: It was more actual pressure than January 2016, but far less intense, because in January 2016 all of the responsibility was on me, and no one got in my way, and I had a strong vested interest in the actual work, which caused me to spend all my time on the work (including way out of hours).</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>These two subthemes were partly used to destroy most of the stress:-</p>
    <p><br>Subtheme: We Three Kings (Love to Sing).<br>YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBwL3y-Wlms" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBwL3y-Wlms</a><br><br>Subtheme: Little Donkey (Anonymous).<br>YouTube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHLVM4MJgmo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHLVM4MJgmo</a></p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Note: I had not heard the song ‘Little Donkey’ since the Nativity (probably in the 1990s). I think it suits December 1994.</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>At home, I had a sleep. I had one of the best dreams I have ever had (which had lots of family members, including ones I never see, such as second cousins on my mother's side). We had a big dinner at the table. Also there were plenty of adventures with the Overgod that were planned (and everyone could fly - that was just taken for granted as a normal ability).<br><br>I decided that the dream cancels out the possible low rating enough to make the day balanced at about a 65, which is okay.<br><br>I got up before 10pm (so it wasn't too late). Then I had a meal (and cup of tea) as well as updated the entries for this month so far.</p>
    <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Weather Reports - Parody</u></h3>
    <p class="writing"><br>News: Good job with the beach resort, people. It's time to bring you up to speed on the weather so you know what you're dealing with. This is Rain - the self appointed weather in the UK.<br><br>Computer: (beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep).<br><br>News: Stand by, I'll link us up.<br><br>Reporter: Condition critical. You know when this beach was wet? It was covering a big snowstorm that intelligence somehow missed. We need backup now. Snowflakes are pouring out of the clouds, stopping all traffic. We've got grit the roads, and eliminate all black ice before we lose our means of transport. I don't know how long we can hold out.<br><br>News: Damn! You heard the man, what are you waiting for?</p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Meanwhile, at the Met Office</p>
    <p class="writing"><br>Meteorologist: Well... there's no stopping overcast, is there? Now rain wants to sweep over this village. It's the last bit of warm front standing between it and the high pressure zone. There is some frost there, but it's quickly melting, so you should be able to handle it quite easily. Oh, and don't worry about any low temperatures. Intelligence tells me, there are just a few cirrus clouds lurking about.</p>
    <p class="writing note"><br>Note: that was based on these two videos:-</p>
