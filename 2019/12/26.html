        <p class="writing">Sleep (in 4th Headquarters).<br><br>I had a nice Boxing Day.<br><br>At around 19:00, the Overgoddess and the Overgod put The Terror Episode 8 on, so I went for a walk around Overheaven.<br><br>I went from Hgwrtz to the near end of the central road, and felt more and more drunk and travel-sick (but didn't vomit).<br><br>I thought people would be worrying about me, that the Overgoddess would be worried about me crossing the roads and the Overgod would come looking for me, so I thought I would take a route that he wouldn't go on. I went past the Nest and up the First Alleyway, onto the school road, past Overheaven School, and out on the next road, past the pub with the Christmas tree. I took a picture of the Christmas tree there. All this time, I was avoiding people because I didn't know how I would be able to interact with anyone.<br><br>I tried to go to Overheaven Park by going down the Dog Poo Walk first (and got the torch out to check where I was walking). There was no dog poo. After the tarmac part was a lot of mud, which I walked around, and I could hear the squelches very vividly. I decided that it would be too hard to get to Overheaven Park from there, so I turned back through the mud again. My vision became very vivid too now, and it looked like it was separating into red, green and blue pixels.<br><br>Now half of me wanted to get back home in case it was unsafe, because it was getting a bit like the scene where Homer Simpson has hallucinations from the chilli, and I thought it would get worse and worse because it was only about 30 or 40 minutes since it started. But the other half wanted to stay outside and listen to some nice music and experience the beauty.<br><br>I felt like I had lost my personality and that I could choose a new one, so I thought that I would like one that is more <q>alpha</q>.<br><br>I headed back, down the smoky lane. I didn't look around much directly, but, in my peripheral vision, it was like Silurian Park - the trees were like seaweed, flowers and bushes were like coral and various underwater plants. There was a family packing some things at their driveway about half way through, and they didn't seem out of place, so I thought maybe people cause the illusions to go away.<br><br>Past them, the underwater scenes continued, and at the end of the smoky lane, it looked like the light was green and it was the deepest part. Then I went to the right and on the mini fields where I used to walk when I was in secondary school. I heard that there were people in the field on the other side of the road, and wanted to avoid them. But I was also self conscious that if anyone saw me there, they would think I was a weirdo.<br><br>Further on, I went across the road and onto the field, away from the basketball court (where the people were). The underwater theme came back, so the grass looked like underwater moss. I felt it to check it wasn't flooded (because it was dark), but it just felt like normal grass. It was also foggy here. Nobody was near me, but I was afraid someone might come over, walking their dog. They didn't, though.<br><br>I played the music track there that I wanted to, which was &lsquo;Arisen&rsquo; by Arksun (Original mix, which lasts over 10 minutes). The sky looked purple and like a giant reflector, and the ground was misty, which added to the effect.<br><br>When I closed my eyes, I could also see very detailed scenes, like an aquarium, but could not move through them. In the first one, there was a trench below that looked like it had teeth, and curved around a corner, and there was lots of sea weed and fish (including sharks).<br><br>Since I still felt like I had to go home for safety, I felt like this was the last time I would ever see Silurian Park. So I also put on &lsquo;Underwater World&rsquo; by DMJ-Music, which was sort of sentimental and saying goodbye to the scene.<br><br>I closed my eyes again to see if I could have another vision, and this time there were lots of gears and cobwebs.<br><br>On the way home, it seemed a lot muddier than usual but I had to go through (or around) it to get to the alleyway to go to Hgwrtz. Again, it was very squelchy.<br><br>I went back to the house and inside. No one cared about my experiences or imagined that anything had happened though, which was a surprise to me, but I rolled with it. I checked my boots to make sure they weren't covered in slime from Silurian Park. It looked like they were, but that it wasn't enough to make the house dirty.<br><br>I wanted someone to come with me to Silurian Park again to find somewhere away from people, but no one wanted to.<br><br>I took the boots off and went upstairs to see if I could have visions, and to listen to more music at the same time.<br><br>I felt like I was six years old (including my own bodily perception) and had feelings from that time that I had not thought about consciously since then - such as about <q>Xmas</q> and that I identified with wearing thick striped jumpers. I thought this was very <q>deep</q> because it was deep into my past. Although I wasn't listening to music that I knew from anywhere near that far back.<br><br>Going deeper was also represented by going to the base of a Christmas tree (the old plastic one we used to have).<br><br>I wondered if I could get <q>deeper</q> and uncover more old aspects of myself, so I listened to another music track (possibly &lsquo;Hitsville UK&rsquo; by The Clash) and a new deeper thing came up, from early Primary School or maybe Playschool, which I only knew as either &lsquo;thtip stop&rsquo; or &lsquo;thip top&rsquo; (it is just a feeling that I associate with me being three years old, maybe learning some words, so it's meaningless to everyone except me). Visions of my old drawing style appeared too.<br><br>I tried to go even deeper, and probably listened to &lsquo;We Belong To the Sea&rsquo; by Aqua. I imagined being in the junkyard of my mind (like in &lsquo;Inside Out&rsquo;), amongst old and abandoned things from my childhood, including the blue car, which was half underwater. I tried to find something under the seat there and found a hydra (sea creature), but it was the size of a hand - I thought maybe this represents the <q>Curse</q>. There was also a kiwi fruit involved (cut in half), but that was probably deeper and with less meaning.<br><br>I listened to some childhood songs, and got visions from one of them that seemed like <q>Fairy Unicorn Land</q> (pink and silver stuff). Also, there was a music video which was based on an old nursery rhyme book that created the landscapes.<br><br>I listened to &lsquo;The Windmills of Your Mind&rsquo; by Dusty Springfield, and the visions here were more like a James Bond intro but with a glossy gold ornament of a unicorn.<br><br>Then I wanted to find something even deeper, so I listened to &lsquo;Orinoco Flow&rsquo; by Enya. But this time, it was more like the deep ocean, with a whale, and lots of darkness. So maybe there was nothing deeper that could be seen. I listened to &lsquo;Upside Down&rsquo; by A*Teens, to see what music video my mind would generate, and it was like a frozen upside-down stilletto of a woman who was standing there, but it was just spinning around the bottom from under the ice. Then, at the end, there were loads of glitter rockets, even though the end isn't that climactic.<br><br>I thought of <q>kitten trilobites</q> and a phrase kept appearing in my head that was something along those lines, including <q>triassic</q>.<br><br>I wanted to listen to more music, but I also wanted to go outside for a walk, so now I kept checking downstairs. The walk wasn't happening yet, but I saw a funny video with &lsquo;In the Hall of the Mountain King&rsquo; in the background, so I went upstairs and listened to that to see what visions I would have. This time, it was a lot of brown wax hexagonal prisms pulsating and being viewed from different angles, which I also associated with grandfather clocks.<br><br>The visions were not as potent any more, and I decided to go out for a walk with the Overgod, the Duke and the Baroness. My senses were normal again, but I felt like I had lost track of my mental age and that my three-year-old self was with me at the same time. Also, the sky looked wispy and like an illusion, but it was probably like that in real life (due to the time of year and the weather). A hill in the distance looked like something from &lsquo;Hyper Light Drifter&rsquo;, which the Baroness was playing these days.<br><br>We watched some of &lsquo;The Terror&rsquo; Episode 7. Later, I went to the Nest, for bed in 2nd Headquarters.</p>
