<p class="writing">I heard today's music theme from someone's video about Conway's Game of Life. It showed that there is such thing as a “stargate”, which “apparently” can transmit data faster than light. Someone made an unclear explanation of why it doesn't actually transmit data faster than light, based on the assumption that it's not possible, and saying the original information is destroyed but the “signal” is transmitted as to whether to destroy what is being created on the other side. But isn't that “signal” still information?<br><br>Later in the day, I realised how the stargate actually works, which led to me discovering how the speed of light could be broken in cellular automata (and in my opinion it actually does transmit information faster than light).<br><br>Firstly, it is established that the “light speed” is one pixel per frame, and since every pixel can only affect the adjacent pixels in one frame, it is assumed that no information or thing can travel faster than that speed.<br><br>So, here is the ingenious way that you can transmit information faster than light. If you have a “space ship”, as 1 bit of information, that can travel at the speed of light, but is several pixels long, then when it goes into the “stargate”, it sends a signal, also at the speed of light, to the other side. The other side constantly makes copies of the same type of “space ship”, which takes time but the last bit of the space ship is based on the aforementioned signal, and says whether or not the outgoing space ship will be destroyed. If there is no signal, it creates an unstable version of the outgoing space ship if the signal was transmitted. Thus, the whole space ship disintegrates and is not sent. However, if there is a signal, then a stable space ship is made. So the output has the same pattern of space ships as the input, but is a couple of pixels ahead. If you line up several stargates in a row, then it will be several pixels ahead.<br><br>Here is a nice demo:-<br>

<p class="note writing"><br>Note: This is not likely to be usable to break light speed in real life, unless we discover that the Universe is a 3D cellular automaton, in which case it might be possible but would need the ability to “program” the universe to create the stargates and the right kind of space ships with the right spacing. And such an ability probably is as fantastical as the ability to just draw the signal on your desired destination, so it's instantly there, which is a lot faster and simpler than using stargates.</p>
<p class="writing"><br>There were no pancakes today. I didn't find out that it was Pancake Day until the day was over.<br><br>Work. I seemed to get massive headaches after having caffeine today, instead of before it. Maybe my body has suddenly got caffeine resistance?<br><br>On the way back, I heard ‘Keep on Moving’ (Five), for the first time in maybe 19 years.<br><br>Home. I made dinner, then went for an evening sleep from about 8pm. I had a small amount of actual sleep (maybe half an hour), with messing around for the rest, even though I had just watched a video saying you should not waste your time because you never get it back. I got back up at about 11pm, and had a shower and a cup of tea.</p>
