<p class="writing"><br>We get a little bit of sun in the morning and ‘Walking on Sunshine’ (Katrina and the Waves) comes on the radio.<br><br>By the way, I had heard that song long before Hurricane Katrina, but I didn't know what the band name was, so I never made the connection until today.<br><br>Home. Since They (the Council) had not taken the rubbish yesterday, I pulled the big green bag out, but a heavy glass door (not connected to anything) was in the way, and that fell flat on Wally's clothes (which he had put out to “dry” even though it was rainy all day) and also maybe broke a nearby plant pot. It was very close to breaking through Wally's door also, so it could have been worse. It ripped my skin between fingers 7 and 8 (that is, between the index and middle finger on my right hand), so I had to wash that and put sulphur powder on it.<br><br>Wally also got me to put the heating on more when no one is in the house because he complained that it was cold when he got back inside or woke up at these times when no one usually has heating on. Though this is likely to trigger the Landladi to increase the rent.</p>

<h3 class="writing"><br><u>Pills</u></h3>
<p class="writing"><br>Blue pill - In the Matrix, this is more like a placebo, it does nothing really, but keeps you as a conforming human. In real life, it lets you stay as a “normie”. At least you are normal.<br><br>Red pill - In the Matrix, this allows you to be a literal “outsider”, being able to go outside the Matrix and live in the real world. In real life, it makes you an “edge lord”.<br><br>Green pill - In the Matrix, this turns you into an Agent. In real life, it means you work for the Government or as a social engineer, to keep the people in line.<br><br>Magenta pill - The combination of red and blue pill. In the Matrix, it essentially is the same as red pill but you aren't suspected by Agents and also if someone pulls the plug out of your head, you just wake up in real life and don't die (unlike the red pill). In real life, you are a spy or super-illuminati, at least know what's going on but nobody suspects you.<br><br>Cyan pill - The combination of blue and green pill. In the Matrix, you are more of an enforcer, soldier or government worker who enforces normal behaviour. In real life, you are a “white knight”, enforcing the current year's norm on people who step out of line.<br><br>Yellow pill - The combination of red and green pill. So you know about the Matrix but you also enforce it, and would have built it if you could, because you want humans to be used as batteries. Which means you are probably a robot / machine or a pro-robot person. In real life, you are evil.<br><br>Black pill - In the Matrix, this is no pill at all, making you freak out at everything weird instead of being normal. In real life, this is the overly depressing cynical pill, turning you into an emo or maniac.<br><br>White pill - The combination of red, blue and green. This means you are a double agent and also able to do whatever you want, and switch sides at will.</p>
