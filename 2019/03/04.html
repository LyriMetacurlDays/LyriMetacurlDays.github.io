<p class="writing note">Note: Unlike yesterday, the music theme did suit today and was very prominent throughout the day.</p>
<p class="writing"><br>Sleep was from about 02:30 to 07:50.<br><br>This was the only day (to my knowledge) that I ever didn't take my blazer to work (so far) (with the exception of Primary School, College and Non-Uniform days). It had its benefits, too, for example, I didn't get hot from walking to the bus (and it wasn't too cold, since I had my raincoat).<br><br>At Work, I started being a Tableau guy again (like this time last year).<br><br>Apparently, the weather was <q>pie weather</q> (according to the radio). That is, cloudy and windy with the occasional bit of rain. Although I didn't eat any pie.<br><br>After Work, I went for an afternoon sleep. This time, which hasn't happened for quite a few days, I actually did fall asleep though - with no alarms. I had some nice dreams, including a family based one that took place in the Diverse version of the Boss and Wizard's house, mostly in the Guests' Room. This has featured several times in my dreams over the years (and decades), but I may not have described it. It is pretty much like the Universe version of the Guests' Room, but a bit bigger, just a square shape, with pink walls, two double beds with a shared table, a fridge, and lots of toys. Also, the closet contains a small room with blue walls and more toys, and one person can sleep there too. That is one of the most legendary places in the multiverse.<br><br>After I woke up, which was about 22:20, I started to make dinner (chicken butties).<br><br>Shopping. Due to the prices adding up, I got some apples (for the first time in years maybe). They were Braeburn ones, but the first one I had tasted like delicious cream pudding. Maybe apples contain some unique substance that my body was secretly craving, so it tasted like that when reintroduced. Or maybe it was a weird chemical.<br><br>This day seemed to last a very long time, although it was only rated 78 due to the cold (virus), which was in its middle stage now (snotty and sneezy). Though the rating has still been increasing quite a lot over the past few days.</p>
<h3 class="writing"><br><u>Notes</u></h3>
<p class="writing note"><br>It is strange that there is no entry that says this in the past, but, many years ago, I went on Celestia and found that at some long  distance outside the Milky Way, there were only two selectable stars in the Milky Way, and those were Eta Carinae and V838 Monocerotis. Indeed, both of those stars have actually been the #1 most luminous star in the Milky Way at some point in the past 200 years.<br><br>I didn't know Eta Carinae was pronounced <q>eat a ka rai nee</q> until I looked it up.<br><br>Also, around the 1840s, Eta Carinae was the second brightest star in the sky, despite being 7500 light years away. That's about 20 times further away than Canopus, so it was over five hundred times brighter than it, and Canopus is already ten thousand times brighter than the Sun if it were the same distance away.<br><br>So if Eta Carinae were the same distance away as the Sun during this eruption, it would disintegrate you faster than standing on the surface of the Sun.<br><br>V838 Monocerotis had its most famous time in 2002 (more like 18000 BC when it actually erupted), but may erupt again. Eta Carinae in its normal state, these days, still sits comfortably at the #2 most luminous known star in the Milky Way (behind WR 25). At least, that's what I found at this time - in a review only a few years later, Eta Carinae was officially the brightest star in the Milky Way again (even without being a nova).<br><br>Many (but not most) stars do have their short bit of fame at the #1 position, at some point in their lives, usually when they go supernova.</p>
