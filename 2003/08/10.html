        <p class="writing note">Note: The date is approximate. It could be off by weeks. However, I have decided to put it on the hottest day of the decade (in the UK), since I remember it was extremely hot on this day.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>It was a sunny summer's day. The back garden at the Nest was a nicely mowed lawn.<br><br>The purple and green tent had been set up on it.<br><br>I rested in the tent, in the nice warm sun, for hours. I was using the Overgod's old red and black 1980s cassette player, listening to some of the Overgod's <q>Elvis</q> tape. It had plenty of other tunes on it though, including some by the band &lsquo;Stray Cats&rsquo;. This one became the theme of the day because I kept listening to it, and it suited the sunny weather.<br><br>At some point, I invented a <q>scary</q> music, to suit a scary insect crawling. The numerical graphic score of it is:-<br><br>3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2... etc.<br><br>Almost like the Gaster theme that Toby Fox made at a later date, but that starts half way through the beat instead and is much less dramatic, but more mysterious.<br><br>In the tent, I was reading the &lsquo;Laurel and Hardy&rsquo; comprehensive book, which had pictures from all the &lsquo;Laurel and Hardy&rsquo; films. Part of today's title was named after the summary of the &lsquo;Laurel and Hardy&rsquo; episode titled &lsquo;Their Purple Moment&rsquo;.<br><br>So now you understand the meaning of the title of the day. Which you probably didn't before you read this entry.<br><br></p>
