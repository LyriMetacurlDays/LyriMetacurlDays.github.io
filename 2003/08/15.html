        <p class="writing"><br>Got up and got dressed.<br><br>Today, the Overgod took me, the Emperor and the Viscount towards Whitby for a camping trip. Along the way, he searched up and down for a cactus collector.<br><br>He found the cactus collector and his giant collection of cacti.<br><br>He held out a small cactus told me and the Viscount, <q>This is a Notocactus</q>. Then he showed us a fake cactus and said <q>and this is not a cactus</q>.<br><br>We went to the outskirts of Whitby, in a high road overlooking the town. It was a proper campsite and we set up the tent in a field. The Overgod remarked at how all the campers were spaced as far away from each other as possible, as if to claim as much space for themselves as possible.<br><br>The Overgod took us Saltwick Bay. It was the first time I, the Emperor or the Viscount had ever been there. It was in the early morning. We climbed down the steep path. On the way down, I had the music &lsquo;Bugs&rsquo; (Basil Poledouris) in my head.<br><br>Looked at the tide.<br><br>At the bottom of the steep path, was a beach. Saltwick Bay Beach. The tide was relatively out. There were supposed to be lots of fossils (particularly ammonites) on this beach, famously.<br><br>Had a 50 minute sleep.<br><br>Breakfast: Oat Bran Crispies.<br><br>Further along the beach, there was a rock that looked like a submarine. Hence it got its name, &lsquo;Sub Rock&rsquo;.<br><br>Went and paddled in the tide for 1.5 hours.<br><br>Bought Mint Cornetto ice cream and ate it.<br><br>Went to the campsite on the other side of Whitby (Cross Butts Farm Campsite).<br><br>Set up tent at Cross Butts Farm Campsite.<br><br>Had music contest – the Emperor's tape vs ‘Into the Valley’ (Skids).<br><br>Dinner: Chicken paste butties.<br><br>Played football, highcatch and artillery on the campsite (with the football).<br><br>Went to the beach and used the dinghy.<br><br>Fell in the water with small weird-looking jellyfish in it.<br><br>Rescued clothes 1 minute before Sub Rock was drenched.<br><br>Went back to the car.<br><br>Tea: Chilli beans and spaghetti with herbs and bread.<br><br>Went with the Emperor to the Petrol Station in Whitby to buy chocolate bars.<br><br>Ate Snickers: The Big One.<br><br>Slept for an hour.<br><br>Phoned the Overgoddess with the mobile phone to check the Nest.<br><br>Prepared for sleep.<br><br>Went to sleep in the tent.</p>
