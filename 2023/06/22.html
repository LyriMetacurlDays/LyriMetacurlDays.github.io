        <h1>The Titan Disaster</h1>

        <p>Date: 22nd <a href="../06.html"><u>June 2023</u></a></p>

        <p>Music theme: Team Star Grunt Theme (version 1) (TPCi).<br>

        <p class="writing note">Note: The music theme of the day is an interesting one because it's a <q>grunt theme</q> from Pok√©mon so it has low expectations set and the first 40 seconds sounds like that, by which time most people will have defeated the grunt and it would stop. However, beyond 40 seconds, it turns into by far the best track in the entire game (agreed by most people, not just me). So it's like a hidden track.<br><br>Note: If you have the number <q>1912</q> (the year of the Titanic Disaster) and flip each number up, it will say <q>2023</q> (the year of the Titan Disaster). Also, there was a story about the Titan Disaster written before the Titanic Disaster but was just eerily similar to the Titanic Disaster. Maybe in the year 3134, there will be another one called <q>The Triton Disaster</q> (or some other Sea God associated names, or maybe the vessel will have an extra-cursed name combination like <q>Tritanic</q>).<br><br>Note: NYA could stand for No Year Attributed. Kind of like the SEPA files now at Work. Well, the individual ones have a year attributed, but I can't have a constant folder called <q>2023</q> for it because I expect to still work at my current Work in later years.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>WFH.<br><br>Walk with the Overgoddess and the Overgod (probably Mt Bump).<br><br>The Titan Submersible was said to run out of air today, but it was also revealed that it had imploded on the 18th of June (which is therefore the real day of the Titan Disaster). Apparently, over the past four days, it was deliberately and maliciously drawn out by the media <q>to cover certain things happening in America.</q><br><br>Aldi and Pub - my round. The Overgoddess came too.<br><br>The Emperor visited later. We probably had a walk.</p>
