        <p class="writing note">Quote of the Day: <q>Would this world be called the World of Shadows because no one can be anything more than a shadow?</q> &mdash; Me.<br><br>Other Quote: <q>Enjoy your bed bug free environment, while you can.</q> &mdash; Me. Due to the fact that bed bugs are exponentially rising throughout the country, it seems inevitable that we will all end up getting infested by them at some point too. Not something we're looking forward to.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br> Emperor invented the example state names <q>This State That Was Set Up Here</q> (TSTWSUH) and <q>This State Here</q> (TSH).<br><br>We came back to Hgwrtz for some chatting, then he went back home.<br><br>Sleep and some dreams, about 02:XX to 11:00. Including the last one, where I went for a Science lesson in room SC1 in Haytown High School, but it was actually where room SC4 used to be, but more to the back, where Technology lessons used to be (the room where I learned about Evaluation being like a story, before the main paper diaries started). The playing field (Seniors) was visible outside and seemed to be out of reach in my memory, and I had a longing to be there (although in 2004, when it was easily accessible, it was boring).<br><br>I updated the diary and went on the computer (Fonsica).<br><br>I thought of the idea of disposable heat exchangers for extracting heat from molten slag.<br><br>The Overgod came.<br><br>I and the Emperor went to the Space Ship, to visit the Yeoman. We had some dinner there (mini long pizzas, potatoes, sausages) and watched some Deep Space Nine - Season 5 Episodes 21, 22 and 23.<br><br>Back at Hgwrtz - we watched Star Wars Rebels, the Second-Last Episode. We also discovered &lsquo;Star Trek Continues&rsquo;, which the Overgod liked because they had replicated the lighting and effects of The Original Series (TOS) very well. It seemed it was pretty much TOS Season 4.</p>
