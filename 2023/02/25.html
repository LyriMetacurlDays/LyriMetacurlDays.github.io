        <p class="writing">I deliberated about what to do today, and decided that it was my last chance to visit the aquarium.<br><br>I got the 11&#58;26 bus to Palma bus station and a connecting one to Palma Aquarium. The second bus was cash only, so fortunate that I had some.<br><br>The aquarium said the word <q>aquarium</q> in English on the actual thing, but I wanted it to be in the local language, like &lsquo;The Maretarium&rsquo; was. I looked up what <q>aquarium</q> is in Catalan and it said it was <q>aquari</q>.<br><br>I went to all the places in Palma Aquarium, including the shark tank boat ride - a square boat with a guide cable, and a window to see down - it was 8.3 metres at the deepest point.<br><br>I got back by about 17&#58;40 (by different bus routes, this time the first one was cash only also). When I got back, I had a little chat with the two other Jet2 helpers (the one who had booked the earlier trips was not there today).<br><br>Raw visited the Aquasol for the first time, and really liked it, wondering why he hadn't come here before. We had a San Miguel. The university girls from yesterday were still there too (just not dressed as pop stars). There was some nice entertainment (strong girls, doing stunts, for example one of them fit into a box, about two foot cube). That was where today's music theme was from, by the way (in case you were wondering why it doesn't suit an aquarium).<br><br>Then we went to the Prince William Pub. It was a lot less crowded than yesterday. I did five karaoke songs (&lsquo;Hotel California&rsquo;, &lsquo;Viva la Vida&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Living Daylights&rsquo;, &lsquo;Kingston Town&rsquo; and apparently one other). Raw did three - &lsquo;Mirror in the Bathroom&rsquo;, &lsquo;You Really Got Me&rsquo; and a Bob Marley one.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Memo</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>Raw told me how to say <q>do taschi mash te</q> (<q>You're Welcome</q> in Japanese)</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>Notes</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* The new <q>smallest positive difference between me giving a theme tune to a day and then hearing it and wondering what it is</q> occurred today - the theme song from two days ago was on and I wondered what it was that was playing.<br><br>* The marker originally came down here (in the paper diary when it was given to me).</p>
