        <p class="writing">We stayed at the Prince William Pub until closing time (about 4am), against our better judgment. I and Raw did more karaoke, then went to our hotels again.<br><br>Back at the Aquasol, I packed up and had the rest of the salami, cheese and salad toasts.<br><br>I only had 45 minutes sleep (05&#58;00 to 05&#58;45) when I got a rude awakening from Raw, calling me repeatedly as if he kept forgetting that he had called.<br><br>Got ready, checked out, got the bus to Palma Airport. I heard the theme song of the year 2001 on the bus, which I consider to be very rare these days.<br><br>Checked in the little rucksack. Got the plane to Manchester. Found trains back.<br><br>I got back to Hgwrtz at 16&#58;45. The Baroness was there also, and I found out that she was due to go to (guess where) Mallorca&#33;<br><br>Aldi and Pub (with the Overgod and the Baroness also).<br><br>Tea: Risotto. The Emperor visited too. We tried watching some Bad Batch, but it was talked over, so we put something else on (like YouTube). I made a joke to the Emperor at some point for leaning on his chair since it made a snapping sound: <q>You leant on your chair so much that my throne snapped&#33;</q></p>
