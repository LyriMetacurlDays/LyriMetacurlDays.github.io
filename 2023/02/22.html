        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: Today's title is a mis-hear of the mis-pronunciation of the tour guide saying <q>golden valley</q>.</p>

        <div class="regular-content">
        <p class="writing">There was about an hour's wait for the bus (08:45 to 09:45). Jet2 was calling them too about the delay. Turns out there was something earlier that caused it (roadworks or the like).<br><br>The bus went to Soller first (despite the route looking more convoluted at first glance, but maybe it was due to the delay). This part was where the mis-hear of today's title happened, in a long tunnel under a mountain with golden rock.<br><br>At Soller, I walked on the promenade to the left first, took some photos, and then back and on the promenade on the right (there was a wooden train that goes along it too, which I saw from a distance but was nowhere near when I walked next to the track). Time was running out and I was looking for a coffee. I managed to find one and get back on the bus just in time (although there were four others later which they had to wait for, so there was no chance of being left behind).<br><br>The next destination was Valldemossa, in which the tour guide told us about the three special pastries or puddings. They were an almond cake, a Mallorcan pastry (which looked like a thick spiral one) and one specific to Valldemossa called a Coca de Patata.<br><br>Then it was the way back to Palmanova. There were many songs on the bus, so I'll make a list of them at the end.<br><br>I went to the Globales after the trip, and beat Raw in the <q>serious chess match</q>, then we did some <q>kamikaze chess</q> which I lost (even with trying to use Stockfish online when I was in dire straits, although I entered the locations wrong, so maybe it would have found a way). More proof-reading of the cat story, on the balcony. I thought Three had incorrectly charged since it said £1.99 instead of £2 and I thought that was a possible scam call from yesterday, and that it shouldn't charge at all for data, but that it needed me to remove the spend cap otherwise there would be no data at all. They said they would refund £5 on the next bill.<br><br>Shopping on the way back (at about 18&#58;30) - more supplies from Eroski.<br><br>No Raw this evening. I microwaved a pizza, inventing my own technique for it. First two minutes on medium, wait a minute, then two minutes on med/high, wait a minute, then one minute on high, wait, and another minute on high and a wait, and it will be done. It worked very well.<br><br>I tried some Spanish lessons on &lsquo;Fluent Forever&rsquo;.<br><br>A kid did a <q>buzz and run</q> (like a knock and run, but with the buzzer). However, due to yesterday's buzz, I wasn't shocked and didn't answer. I heard them running away outside. I thought I should have opened it and said <q>'Ello, Chum</q>.<br><br>I hand-washed some clothes, and put them outside at first.<br><br></p>
