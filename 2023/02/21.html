        <p class="writing">In the morning, I booked the Valldemossa and Soller trip for tomorrow (which I thought would involve mountains or hiking). I got told about the dangerous caterpillars in the pine forests, so that I shouldn't go walking by myself. Later, I looked them up and found that they are called processionary caterpillars. Also, I was told about the other trip which was the Caves of Drach, but I didn't book that yet. The only possible time I could book that now was Thursday 9am to 10am&#33;<br><br>I went upstairs again (to my apartment) and had some Golden Grahams.<br><br>I was told about the Katmandu house (upside down house), which I could see if I went far enough up the road, but would be closed. I went out to see it, and on the way I bought a 3D postcard and stamp, which was originally for the Yeoman. Then I went further and saw the Katmandu house. On the way back, there were cheaper postcards (normal kind), which I got one of (with another stamp).<br><br>Back at the Aquasol, I wrote the psotcards - the 3D one for the Boss and the Wizard, and the other one for the Yeoman. My writing seemed very scruffy.<br><br>I went to the Correos building (blue and yellow), just in time (before 14&#58;30) and had them posted, then went back to the Aquasol.<br><br>This whole escapade had lasted hours, for some reason, so I couldn't go into the sea today. Although I was told, at some point, that I could take an Aquasol towel to the beach, so I bore that in mind for when I could.<br><br>I went to the Eroski supermarket, and bought milk, water and Golden Grahams for Raw, and some cans of cerveza for me (Mahou, San Miguel Special, Ambar and Estrella). At the till, looking at the price, I said <q>diecisiete</q> in the correct Spanish accent (where the <q>c</q> is pronounced <q>th</q> in this case) and was asked if I speak Spanish, to which I replied <q>una poca</q>. They were impressed. Anyway, I had meant <q>dieciseis</q>.<br><br>I delivered the stuff to Raw. We went downstairs for our <q>serious chess game</q>, in which he beat me as usual. Then on the balcony, I proof-read some of his cat story, and had the cans of San Miguel Special and Mahou.<br><br>Back at the Aquasol, I had an all you can eat dinner, with pudding this time (some looked like an opaque pink blob).<br><br>Evening - at the Globales. There was some karaoke on. I didn't do any, but Raw did <q>You Really Got Me</q> (The Kinks), which can be today's subtheme.<br><br>Back at the Aquasol, a kid buzzed the door at the end of the corridor (next to mine) and their dad opened it and said, <q>Wrong flat. It's the next one.</q> Which would have meant my flat, since mine is the only one next to theirs.</p>
