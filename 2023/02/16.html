        <p class="writing">The Overgod's 6027th Birthday. He got a birthday card and a Lowenbrau stein from me.<br><br>WFH.<br><br>The Emperor came early to see me. We watched some episodes of The Mandalorian. Around 20&#58;30, I got dropped off at Overheaven Station (by the Emperor), then got the train to Overhell first. Switched trains. As I went down, a big cloud of train smoke got me and irritated my lungs (probably worse than loads of cigarettes). So I went to the waiting room to recover. Got on the next train, to Manchester Oxford Road, and then another train to Manchester Airport.<br><br>After following the directions to the terminal, Manchester Airport was like the Backrooms at around 22&#58;30 (which I texted the Baroness about). Well, there was one person at one of the desks but everything else was empty. I found where everything was. Floor 2 was the one I entered on, which had the departure gates and toilets. The lift and escalators went between floors 2 and 0 only, although I could see that Floor 1 existed since it could be seen from Floor 0 if you look up, and seemed to be some work offices.<br><br>I got some food, water and a coffee from Starbucks on Floor 0, then had a walk around. There was a signal on Floor 2 but not on Floor 0. I got a text from Raw, saying which train he had gotten on, and that many were cancelled. I checked if he would be able to make it, and the schedules said that he apparently wouldn't be here until about 4am, due to various cancellations.</p>
