        <p class="writing">10am - All You Can Eat breakfast (paid for it).<br><br>2pm - Had a shower, and the cleaner came into the flat, but left their replacement towels and bin bags there. I asked later about what the cleaning schedule would be, so that it wouldn't be disrupted again.<br><br>I put the white clothes on (shorts and t-shirt from yesterday) and the white flip-flops and hat (which I already had from 2018-19).<br><br>I went to the beach and had my first dip in the Mediterranean Sea. I bought a Mallorca lighter from the middle Tabacos shop, and nearly accidentally left my hat and sunglasses there, but a local saved them.<br><br>3pm - met up with Raw at the Globales. Some quick chess attempts, some blackjack, and an attempt at teaching him the rules of shed (card game that featured most prominently in late 2017, also known as <q>b█st█rd</q> and various other sweary names). I only <q>succeeded</q> in getting him to hate that game, even though it's probably the best card game I know.<br><br>6pm - I went back to the Aquasol, put colder clothes on and the New York t-shirt.<br><br>7pm - I missed the dinner, and instead just went on the balcony. Raw cancelled this evening's visit. I had some Golden Grahams (in oat milk) and went to sleep later.</p>
