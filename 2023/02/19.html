        <p class="writing note">Note: This was the first day in 2023 that had a rating of 90 or above (so yes, it was also the new best day of the year at the time, although it was swiftly beaten).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>In the morning, I had some microplastic tea and Golden Grahams, although this time I definitely forgot to use oat milk with the Golden Grahams and thus may have accidentally had some microplastic with it, unfortunately.<br><br>I went out shopping for some new clothes (white t-shirt, white shorts and a Mallorca t-shirt each for me and DC). Also for some games (chess and poker, as Raw had suggested).<br><br>I met up with Raw later (around 3pm). He said he was missing his family.<br><br>We had some unlimited beer and pizza, caught some sun, and played some chess and poker. He expected me to beat him at the chess, but I kept losing and not playing very well (because I couldn't be bothered thinking about it), then also let him play against Stockfish to see what he would do (it easily beat him of course). In the poker, however, I <q>obliterated</q> him (in his own words). Though it wasn't for money this time, which is probably the reason why I won (jinx).<br><br>The sun went behind the buldings at about 4pm again, and at about 6&#58;30pm I went back to the Aquasol for dinner. I made some ham and cheese toast sandwiches and tried the Maysan curry for the first time. It was great.<br><br>I went back to the Globales at about 9&#58;30pm to see the soul music performance. I and Raw also played a free form of blackjack, which was not what I expected (although did actually have some significance of the black jack card, so it is probably the right blackjack). I was a bit frustrated by some seemingly changing rules about when you have to say <q>last card</q> or <q>last cards</q>, before or after you do anything, otherwise your move doesn't count or have to take more cards.<br><br>We had a chat with the German guys from yesterday, outside. Raw said that the plant sprinklers came on at about 23&#58;10 yesterday and did water on some people nearby, so we expected them to come on at the same time, but they didn't, so maybe it was every other day. I actually never saw the sprinklers go off during the entire trip, though.</p>
