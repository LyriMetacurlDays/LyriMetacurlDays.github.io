        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: I had always thought the music theme (which Jet2 uses as if it's their personal theme song) said <q>Darling, oh my head&#33;</q>, so I only found out otherwise today.</p>

        <p class="writing">Manchester Airport - After some time walking between Floor 0 and Floor 2, checking where I might be able to sleep (such as behind the chairs in the closed Pret) and having another Starbucks coffee, I decided to go to Floor 2 because there's a signal there. Raw arrived shortly after, having miraculously caught a different train earlier (e.g. from Piccadilly instead of Victoria).<br><br>He had been lugging a big suitcase and offered me to carry it to the Starbucks on Floor 0, which I did (to his surprise, although he carried it at all other times). He also said he had stayed up the whole previous night as well (already over 24 hours), but somehow could take it.<br><br>At the Starbucks, some teenagers came and asked where we were going, and one of them did an <q>annoying pose</q> at Raw also. So we went back to Floor 2 for a bit. We checked in the big suitcase as soon as possible, which was about 2am.<br><br>Then we were told we could go through Security, but when we got there we saw staff showing a guy their drivers' licences, and he told us that it only opens at 3am and seemed agitated that we would be there. So we wandered around Floor 2 more, until 3am, then went through Security.<br><br>We found a bar that we stayed in for almost three hours, having some pints and staying up more.<br> <br>We went to the gate later, boarding about 06&#58;30.<br><br>The flight landed at about 10&#58;45 in Mallorca (1 hour ahead time zone). Then we got through the passport check queue. Raw got randomly stopped and questioned by the Spanish Police, perhaps due to the way he looked, so I waited for that. Then we were told which (different) buses to get to our hotels in Palmanova.<br><br>When we went outside, it was very hot and sunny and there were palm trees (like it was a <q>Summer Planet</q>), so I took my coat and body warmer off.<br><br>We were told it would be 20 minutes, but it was more like 45 (20 to Palma and 20 to Palmanova with some going around different hotels first in a seemingly convoluted route).<br><br>I checked in to the Aquasol, and slept from about midday, for a few hours.<br><br>At about 20&#58;30, I paid for an All You Can Eat dinner. Very nice.<br><br>Later, I went to the Eroski supermarket (which closes at 21&#58;30 so I must have been pretty quick). I got a <q>7 in 1</q> shampoo, 500g pack of pumpkin seeds, chewies, oat milk, UHT milk (which would become the subject of tomorrow), ham, cheese, Lurpak (small tub), bread (long slices because the toaster was long in the hotel), and saw some Golden Grahams there so I got a pack of those. I noticed that they had some raw fish on display, including anglerfish.<br><br>At the bar at the Aquasol, I ordered a San Miguel. The main bar tender there refused to talk if it wasn't in Spanish, although he seemed to understand English fine and got everything right (just used body language). I bore this in mind for next time. I went to the entertainment hall and watched this evening's entertainment, which was Bingo at first. The Bingo guy called out the numbers in Spanish, English and French, quite well. Next was a quiz entitled <q>Which Celeberty Is This</q> [sic].<br><br>By the way, tomorrow's theme song was on today, but I decided to just use it for tomorrow.</p>
