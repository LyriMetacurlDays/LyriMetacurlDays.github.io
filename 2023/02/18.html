        <p class="writing">At the start of the day, I presumably had some Golden Grahams, but can't remember if I wrongly opened the UHT milk here or the oat milk.<br><br>I met up with Raw at sme point, around 2pm near a yellow digger. Raw showed me some shops (mostly back the way I had came). One of them was what we called <q>The Ramp</q> Supermarket, which supposedly has everything. I got a small blue rucksack so that I could take back things like the shampoo from yesterday, which wouldn't be able to get through hand luggage security. Picking it up caused a security tag to sound an alarm at first, ironically from bringing it into the shop, but the shopkeeper seemed unfussed, like it happens often.<br><br>We went to the Globales, where Raw was staying, and had some unlimited beer and pizza there, and caught some sun. The sun disappeared behind the buildings shortly after 4pm, making it cold. Raw showed me his flat and gave me some Yorkshire Tea bags, as well as a box of Maysan curry, which he said was the best thing ever (way better than Aromat). I also mentioned Golden Grahams being the number 1 best cereal and he hadn't heard of them either and thought Coco Pops was the undisputed best. So I thought I'd get him a packet of them later.<br><br>Back downstairs, we had some cervezas (beer) at the bar, and he went for a quick All You Can Eat, while I got a sangria (which was described as <q>Typical Spanish Drink</q>), but I think it's in the song <q>Perfect Day</q>.<br><br>There were a couple of German guys there, and one of them looked Mexican. They said they would play poker with us.<br><br>Later on, I walked back to the Aquasol (around 11pm) and had some Yorkshire Tea there with the UHT milk. I needed to use two cups for one tea bag because they were so small. I noticed that some tiny pieces of blue plastic from the lid floated up to the top of the tea, which I took out. They were caused by the way the lid scrapes itself when opening it (bad design).</p>
