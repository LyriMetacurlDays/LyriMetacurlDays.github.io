        <p class="writing">Today was pretty cursed.<br><br>I took the drying clothes into the living room briefly, since it was cold outside, but noticed later that they had done a puddle, which I was afraid would soak through, so I toweled it up and put the clothes rack back on the balcony.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>I heard of the song &lsquo;Aria Math&rsquo; (C14).<br><br>I booked the Caves of Drach trip for tomorrow, and also told the Jet2 representative about the buzz and run from last night (in which I should have said <q>'Ello Chum</q>, like in Pirates of the Caribbean&#58; The Curse of the Black Pearl). Also, I mentioned to her, there has been a crazy woman in a room next to mine (not the one from Tuesday) who keeps shouting, doing a single loud bang that sounds like they're dropping a bowling ball every night, and repetitively saying something that sounds like <q>[American accent] A-men. A-men. A-men.</q><br><br>The wifi was off for most of today, due to repairs, but the mobile internet worked and apparently didn't charge (or so I thought). Also, it was cloudy and colder than usual, so no sea dips.<br><br>Coffee and ice cream downstairs. There was a guy there who can be called <q>The Chum</q> (who is English, by the way).<br><br>There were no visits to Raw today, as he claimed to have food poisoning, or maybe he had eaten too much (all you can eat).<br><br>I had lots of pumpkin seeds (since I needed to finish the pack during the stay). I did some Spanish lessons on &lsquo;Fluent Forever&rsquo;. There was some frustration with the &lsquo;Mega&rsquo; app also. The mobile internet stopped, seemingly for no reason, but the wireless was back on by that time, so I didn't lose Internet today.<br><br>I went downstairs for a San Miguel. Some football was on at the time. The Chum chattered to me out of the blue and touched my arm. I wasn't sure if he was just being friendly. I finished the beer and went back upstairs, and the day came to an end.</p>
