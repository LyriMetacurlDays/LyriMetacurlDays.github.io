        <p class="writing">Drach Caves trip. The bus was not very late this time.<br><br>The name down on the ticket was that of the Jet2 assistant who booked it, instead of me, but they had the correct apartment number and destination, and let me on, although I first thought it might be the wrong bus.<br><br>The tour guide was like Stellan Skarsg√•rd's portrayal of Shcherbyna from Chernobyl (2019).<br><br>We went to the Pearl shop first, and I had a coffee there. The most expensive thing they had was a pearl chess set.<br><br>Back on the bus, I thought I'd been pickpocketed but I had just put my wallet in a different pocket. There was an old local couple next to me, who I tried talking to, but they said they only speak Spanish, so I tried that and was pretty successful.<br><br>At the caves, I took lots of pictures, watched the classical performance, and went on the boat as well.<br><br>The caves seemed full of enough people, even though it was February. The tour guide later said that at peak times, there are usually 500 to 800 visitors to the caves.<br><br>Raw called on the way back, when I was still in Palma (the bus was dropping people off). When it got to Palmanova, it drove past the exact place where Raw was (Canblanc), then took me back to the Aquasol.<br><br>I got stuff ready for a dip in the sea at that beach, then went to see Raw. He had seemingly gone, but he was there. I went for a dip in the Mediterranean Sea there, with my swimming trunks this time, slightly deeper than on Monday, but it was too cold to bother going any further. I had a cerveza at Canblanc.<br><br>Back at the Aquasol, I had an all you can eat dinner. A London University's netball class also visited Aquasol, dressed as pop stars.<br><br>I had two San Miquels in the hall and watched the entertainment this evening - bingo and a music performer. The university students went to the Prince William Pub (which the staff told me about) to do karaoke of their songs. I went to check it out, but it was too crowded and hot. Although, there was an <q>outer shell</q> which had hardly anyone in, so Raw and DC were convinced that it was dead (from my picture) even though it was rammed.<br><br>I went back to the Aquasol and went to sleep.<br><br></p>
