        <p class="writing">Today was the last full day at Mallorca.<br><br>More karaoke at first (at the Prince William Pub). A Spanish girl asked me if I speak Spanish. She went back to her friends, and we left since we were too tired.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>All you can eat breakfast. Not a massive amount, though. I took lots of &lsquo;Té Rojo&rsquo; (Pu-Erh tea, but I called it <q>Red Tea</q> because that's what &lsquo;Té Rojo&rsquo; means. Even though black tea is more red than it, really.<br><br>I went to the Globales in the afternoon, and met Raw in his flat, about 2pm. We had some cervesas at Canblanc. I asked about the packets of crisps and the owner said I could have one for free.<br><br>After 5pm, I and Raw went on a beach walk afterwards, taking some photos. I saved some little rocks as souvenirs. It was still sunny enough at the time (since there were no buildings for the sun to go behind after 4pm).<br><br>Later, we went to the Aquasol for some San Miguels. I wanted to fit the last activities in today and have a nice sleep, and thought time was running out for me to make my toast sandwiches, since Raw was just hanging at the bar, so I rushed up to make some salami, cheese and salad toasties and brought them down, thinking Raw might leave if I didn't rush. He didn't though, and was surprised I could make dinner that fast. I had it downstairs in a paper bag so it wasn't that obvious eating my own food near the bar (although I wasn't aware of any rule against it either). I didn't get a chance to make the rest of the toast though now.<br><br>We went to the Prince William Pub at about 10pm, in the hopes that we would see the Jake Paul vs Tommy Fury boxing match and then go home to sleep for our journey home tomorrow, but instead it only started at about 23:30 or later and dragged on past midnight...</p>
