        <p class="writing">I <q>heard</q> the term <q>Perry the Teenage Girl</q>. Probably a mis-hear.<br><br>At Raw's house, with Taw, Tawa, Jaja, Nate and Jojo. We had some chats and decided to go to the coffee shop at some point, at which Taw and Tawa went there (maybe on some public transport or maybe they just walked early). There were a bunch of delays then, and they were waiting, so I ran to town (like old times) and met them there. I listened to &lsquo;C&amp;C Thang&rsquo; (Frank Klepacki) on the way as well, to help with the running.<br><br>At the coffee shop, I had a coffee and waited, chatting with Taw and Tawa.<br><br>Shazam didn't know what the song playing was, but Taw did, so I found it from his guess (correctly).<br><br>The others arrived later, but then we decided to walk back to Raw's place (and did so). We had some cake there. DC might have dropped in as well.<br><br>Taw and Tawa were the first to leave, if I remember correctly. Then DC took me also, maybe for some food.<br><br>I and DC went to Pixel bar for about 21:00 to 23:30. I played some Descent Shareware Overloaded. On Steam, someone had called the space ship there <q>looks like a chibi Pyro</q>, so that's how today got its name.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: For today's rating, I debated whether it should be a 96, but kept it as 95, just that it is officially better than the 18th of March 2023 if there's any debate. This means it is the best day since 3rd of October 2021 until the next time there's another 96 or above.</p>
