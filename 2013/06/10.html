        <p class="writing note">Note: The music theme today was also one of my top favourite songs (it was my second-favourite music track for a year or two).</p>
        <p class="writing"><br><br>I accidentally locked myself out of 8th Headquarters when I just had my dressing gown on and no phone either. I broke in for the second time (the first was 17th August 2012). The lock flew off (it was even easier than the first time because it was more flimsy from that time).<br><br>It couldn't lock at all now because it would just fall off, so I went to Unipol for an urgent repair.<br><br>Unipol called the Maintenance Guy, who came and fixed it pretty quickly, with extra long screws this time, so it is now super hard to break in and you have to take extra care and ask people for phone use if you lock yourself out of your room without your phone and clothes (no matter how embarrasing it would be). I didn't get charged (probably because the Maintenance Guy thought the job was too easy).<br><br>I met MJ in the Building later that day.<br><br>There was a Mind Matters peer session that evening.<br><br>There was also a Skype session in the night (with the Emperor).</p>
