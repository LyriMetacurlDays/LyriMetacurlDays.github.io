        <p class="writing note">Note: Unlike many songs, the normal version of the above is the instrumental version, and there is a separate vocal version with added words. Also, I believe this song was meant to signify that Valerie is the saviour of the Metacurl Family (since she was my first girlfriend). It's one of Valerie's strongest essence themes.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>The Overgod, the Viscount and the Countess visited. We went with Valerie to Baildon and Ilkley Moor Centre (from the South side).<br><br>We decided to name the unnamed lane from the South side of Ilkley Moor “Standard Lane”, because it looked like a standard lane. Note that there is a lane called “Street Lane” in Leeds, so it's not that much of a step.<br><br>We had some chips. They took ages to arrive, so we joked that they must be growing the potatoes first. I had some gravy on mine and shared them with Valerie.<br><br>We went back to Leeds and dropped Valerie off at her place at about 19:00, then went back to 8th Headquarters for a bit.<br><br>I texted her later asking if she wants to come out to the pubs with us, which she replied yes to.<br><br>We picked her up again and drove to the car park near St Marks, then we went to the Pack Horse and the Fenton, for drinks.</p>
