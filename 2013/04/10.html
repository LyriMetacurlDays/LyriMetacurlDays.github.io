        <h1>Non-Stop Inertia 3 – The Specific Evaluatee and the General Evaluator</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 10th <a href="../04.html"><u>April 2013</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r90 nc">&nbsp;90&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Music theme: In It For The Money (Censored version) (Client).<br>

        <p class="writing note">Note: For a short while, the music above actually became my number one favourite song (rather than ‘Curiosity’ by Carly Rae Jepsen, although that did win again a few days later).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <div class="regular-content">
        
        <p class="writing note">Quote of the Day: “Quirky sense of humour” – Kartik, explaining to the audience everything there is to know about Lyri.<br><br>Joke of the Day: “I went for my car insurance yesterday, and they told me the insurance doesn't cover for acts of God. So imagine my frustration when I looked out of the window this morning to see the Lord, scratching my car up the side with his keys.”</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>I finished reading ‘Non-Stop Inertia’ (Ivor Southwood) today. It referred to the song which became today's theme. That is how I discovered it, and also how I discovered the band ‘Client’.<br><br>I realised that the empirical advice books which I have been reading lately, which my pals and family have been calling “theory”, cannot actually be correctly referred to by the term “theory”. Theory is something that means an attempt to explain and predict phenomena (of any kind), whereas empirical study simply tells you what happened, and what happens in general, without attempting to explain why (or even a complex explanation of how). If an experienced person tells you what happened (especially if it is without trying to make sense of it), that is actually second-hand practice, not theory.<br><br>I heard that sitting down reduces lifespan by an average of 40&#37;. So ideally everyone's workstations should be designed for some other posture (e.g. suspended from the ceiling by a harness, front-side down) and that would save so much life (and be more productive).<br><br>At White Rose Speakers today, I was the General Evaluator.<br><br>I ate fish and chips afterwards.<br><br>Today got a 90, since the positivity was coming back quite well.</p>
