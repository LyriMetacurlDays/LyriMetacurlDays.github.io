        <h1>Awkwardness</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Date: 30th <a href="../03.html"><u>March 2013</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r99 nc">&nbsp;99&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>

        <p class="writing note">Note: the main theme music theme is intentionally awkward and intense.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <div class="regular-content">
        
        <p class="writing">Today I read most of the book &lsquo;Awkwardness&rsquo; by Adam Kotsko, and I was at the Space Ship all day. I was greatly de-sensitised to awkwardness because, contrary to intuition, the book framed awkwardness as normal and human, while saying that lack of awkwardness is the trait of a sociopath.<br><br>I had a few cups of coffee.<br><br>I was so sensitive today that I got euphoria just from listening to &lsquo;Call Me Maybe&rsquo; (Carly Rae Jepsen).<br><br>The Overgod, the Emperor, the Viscount and the Countess visited for Tea.<br><br>I watched plenty of old family footage from the video camera(s).<br><br>I awkwardly missed the Boss's birthday.<br><br>Also imagined a big awkward moment that must have happened in a fictional story.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: The goodness rating of today was a whopping 99 - something that had not happened since &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo;. If I had to discriminate further, I would say this day was slightly better than &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo;, so this is the second-best day on the entire record so far. The cause of the goodness was mostly because of the intense euphoria I was getting, which was probably from the specific combination of coffee and Carly Rae Jepsen.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* This day was the latest in this chain, having previously beaten &lsquo;Part of Something&rsquo;. It retained this position for a year and a month, then was beaten by &lsquo;Second Childhood&rsquo;.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Best Day of the Best Month of the Best Year of My Life - Chain</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* Today also beat &lsquo;Part of Something&rsquo; in this department, as was confirmed at the end of 2013. It retained this status for one year, before being beaten by &lsquo;Wild Wold&rsquo;.</p>
