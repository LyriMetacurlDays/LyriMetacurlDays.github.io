        <p class="writing note">Note: I was saving the music theme above for an occasion such as this. Also, it is mysterious what place the song is referring to, but Torquay kind of suits it.</p>
        <p class="writing"><br>It was sunny today, but there was a bit of light rain on the other days. However, Torquay is apparently a popular summer destination, so it feels quite prestigious to be there in May when it's just as good but there are less people.<br><br>Events were not recorded in the paper diary, but there was quite a long bus tour of Torquay, which I took some videos of.<br><br>In the Final, later in the day, the Whisky Guy won the speech contest (in other words, he is now recognised as the best public speaker in Britain and Ireland, so he has to enter the World Conference next, which I heard is in Las Vegas).</p>
