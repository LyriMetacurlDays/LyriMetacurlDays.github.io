        <p class="writing">I prepared the rucksack and packed some things, including the 2013 paper diary and Tibertwo (the more portable laptop, which I was commonly using at the time).<br><br>The Awesome Atheist (and his wife) picked me up after midday and we drove to Torquay (about five hours). I quite liked his choice of music in the car.<br><br>I wandered Torquay and found the place that I would be staying (a three-star hotel). I was introduced to my little room, which was very cosy and compact. They replaced the tea and coffee regularly.<br><br>I went out to the introductory social event that evening, and met some fellow Toastmasters. We had some drinks (and maybe fish and chips). Later that night, there was a craic (Irish style singing event).<br><br>Today was such a mega day in my life, I'm surprised not much was written on it. Just that it didn't make it into the top best or most legendary this year (though it had plenty of both).</p>
