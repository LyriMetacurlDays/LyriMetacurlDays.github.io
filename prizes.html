        <p><br></p>
        <p>There are various symbols for days and sometimes months around. Here is a list of them.</p>
        <p><br></p>
      </div>


        <div class="regular-content">
<p><br></p>
<h2>Common</h2>
<h3>Not really a prize but just the usual symbol.</h3>
<p>&#8226; Normal day with a known date.</p>
<p>&#8251; A group of days, or an day with an unknown date (placed on an approximate date instead).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Monthly</h2>
<h3>Every month the monthly prizes are given out.</h3>
<p><span class="representative">&#9789;</span> Red moon - Representative Day of the Month (the day with the same theme song as the month).</p>
<p><span class="firstplace">&#9786;</span> Green smiley face - Best Day of the Month.</p>
<p><span class="secondplace">&#9786;</span> Blue smiley face - Second Best Day of the Month.</p>
<p><span class="lastplace">&#9785;</span> Black sad face - Worst Day of the Month.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Yearly</h2>
<h3>Every year the monthly prizes are given out.</h3>
<p><span class="representative">&#9819;</span> Black queen or solid red queen with a red glow - Representative Day of the Year (the day with the same theme song as the year). This may or may not be different to a Representative Day of a Month, since those can have a smaller but stronger sphere of influence, while these have a wider sphere of influence over the whole year.</p>
<p><span class="deputyrep">&#9813;</span> White queen or hollow white queen with a red glow - Deputy Representative Day of the Year. Similar to the Representative but slightly less influence over the year or maybe it spread over multiple years. So it may or may not have a wider sphere of influence. Also may or may not be the same as a Representative Day of a Month.</p>
<p><span class="firstlegend">&#9818;</span> Gold king - Most Legendary Day of the Year. Usually the most memorable or epic.</p>
<p><span class="secondlegend">&#9812;</span> Silver king - Second Most Legendary Day of the Year. Runner-up.</p>
<p><span class="thirdlegend">&#9812;</span> Bronze king - Third Most Legendary Day of the Year. Consolation prize.</a></p>
<p><span class="firstplace">&#9733;</span> Green solid star - Best Day of the Year. This will also always be the Best Day of a Month.</p>
<p><span class="secondplace">&#9733;</span> Blue solid star - Second Best Day of the Year. This will usually be the Best Day of a Month, otherwise it will be the Second Best Day of a Month (if the Best Day of the Year is in the same month).</p>
<p><span class="topten">&#9734;</span> Cyan hollow star - Top ten best days of the Year - 3rd to 10th place. Often will share best Monthly prizes too but sometimes don't if the yearly prizes are too concentrated.</p>
<p><span class="lastplace">&#129324;</span> Swearing emoji with a black glow - Worst Day of the Year. This will also always be the Worst Day of a Month.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Rare</h2>
<h3>Some rare prizes.</h3>
<p><span class="titleistheme">&#9830;</span> Magenta diamond - A day where the theme song (track name) is the same as the title (or an alternate title) of the day. I once assessed these as being about 1 in 500 and intend to keep them very rare.</p>
<p><span class="deputyrep">&#9830;</span> White diamond with a red glow - Life milestone. There are only 6 possible ones in progressing difficulty or time. Events such as first relationship, marriage, fatherhood (divided into three steps) and the final one is grandfatherhood.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Decadal</h2>
<h3>Every decade these are confirmed, but they may be updated during the decade too as it progresses.</h3>
<p><span class="representative">&#9733;</span> Red solid star - Representative Day of the Decade. This may or may not be the same as another representative day, since its influence is spread over the whole decade instead of concentrated in its own year or month.</p>
<p><span class="firstplace">&#9880;</span> Green plant. - Best Day of the Decade. Also for the month with the highest maximum rating of the decade.</p>
<p><span class="firstplace">&#10048;</span> Green hollow flowerhead - Best Month of the Decade. The month with the highest average rating of the decade.</p>
<p><span class="firstplace">&#127808;</span> Green four-leaf clover - Month with the highest minimum rating of the decade. Interestingly, if given to a day then it would be the worst day of the month.</p>
<p><span class="lastplace">&#9880;</span> Black plant. - Worst Day of the Decade. Also for the month with the lowest minimum rating of the decade.</p>
<p><span class="lastplace">&#10047;</span> Black solid flowerhead - Worst Month of the Decade. The month with the lowest average rating of the decade.</p>
<p><span class="lastplace">&#9752;</span> Black three-leaf clover - Month with the lowest maximum rating of the decade. Interestingly, if given to a day then it would be the best day of the month.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Event-based</h2>
<h3>Sometimes I used a different symbol to normal, which may be confusing.</h3>
<p>&#62;&#9899; Greater Supermassive Black Hole Problem (late 2020).</p>
<p>&#60;&#9898; Lesser Supermassive White Hole Problem (late 2020).</p>
<p>&#60;&#9899; Lesser Supermassive Black Hole Problem (late 2020 / early 2021).</p>
<p>&#62;&#9898; Greater Supermassive White Hole Problem (early 2021).</p>
