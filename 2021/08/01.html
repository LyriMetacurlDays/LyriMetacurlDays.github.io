        <p class="writing">Sleep.<br><br>Packed up.<br><br>Checked out at 10am.<br><br>Went to the Greasy Pig and had a Half Paralyser, Tea and Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice, by myself this time. It took pretty much an hour to wait for it though, like yesterday.<br><br>12:00 to 14:00 - Royal Park pub. Charged phone and had a pint.<br><br>I walked towards the Hyde Park pub, checked out LS6 Caf√© (it said wait to be seated, so I skipped that). I dropped into a record shop where they were playing the Stranglers songs loudly (&lsquo;Hanging Around&rsquo;, &lsquo;Straighten Out&rsquo;, &lsquo;Nice 'n' Sleazy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Strange Little Girl&rsquo;). Then I went to the Hyde Park pub and had a pint there.<br><br>I met up with Raw at 15:00. I told him about the Absolute Horror Disaster and what I feel like doing about it. He mentioned that when you turn the Heineken (which I had a pint of) logo upside-down, the &lsquo;e&rsquo;s spell <q>666</q>, which is evil. I mixed some with Guinness and called it <q>Heaven and Hell</q> beer (a combination that sounds like it would be terrible but is actually not bad). Guinness is the Heaven and Heineken is the Hell.<br><br>I got given a slice of Awesome Cake. I decided to stay an extra night and book Queens Hotel (which had an awesomely cheap night on offer actually, so it was worth it). We went to more pubs (probably the Alchemist and Queens Hotel). Time sped up ridiculously, with each hour seeming to pass every ten minutes or so, but we just took it slow and allowed it to run, in other words we gave time time&#33;<br><br>I had had a total of 9 pints today, making it the co-drunkest day of the 2020s (which will probably not be beaten in the rest of the 2020s because it is too much). The room at Queens Hotel was luxorious, and apparently I would be able to go to the gym there in the morning (included in the price).</p>
