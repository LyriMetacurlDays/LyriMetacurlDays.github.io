    <h3 class="writing"><br><u>The Story of the Temple of the Metal Head</u></h3>
    <p class="writing"><br>Once upon a time in ancient India, there was a man who was made of some kind of hard shiny grey substance. When Krishna spoke to him, he would respond slowly, kind of like a robot. But he was very fast with calculations, super accurate with weapons, and had superhuman strength.<br><br>Krishna knew that this shiny man could turn the tide of the upcoming war, so he asked him - "In the war, who's side will you fight for&#63;"<br><br>The shiny man replied, "I would fight for the weaker side."<br><br>Krishna asked, "What happens when the stronger side becomes weaker&#63;"<br><br>The shiny man replied, "I would switch sides, to the weakest."<br><br>Then Krishna said, "If you did that, eventually, there would be no humans left."<br><br>The shiny man thought about it and said, "That is not a desirable outcome." He didn't know what to do.<br><br>Then Krishna asked the shiny man if he could remove his head and fly over the battlefield to watch. Which the man agreed to. So he must have been a robot (because his head could still talk).<br><br>So the shiny man's head was detached and they observed the war. And after the war, Krishna didn't want to re-activate him, in case he destroys all humans. And so he put him in a box in the Temple of the Metal Head.</p>
