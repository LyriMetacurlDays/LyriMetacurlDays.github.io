        <p class="writing">Existence money paid.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>Breakfast.<br><br>LiL - vi editor.<br><br>Lots of camomile tea today instead of coffee or black tea, due to preparation.<br><br>Walk - Concrete walk (with the Overgoddess and the Overgod). We went back on a loopy road which went past a dumped fridge and other things that someone had fly-tipped.<br><br>The Viscount and the Viscountess visited briefly. I was very overwhelmed by negative emotions about life, and about Banana-head. They comforted me, and agreed that I need to go for a walk to de-stress.<br><br>I went for a walk by myself, towards the Turquoise Bridge to go on the round route (over it). On the way, I walked past two women on a bench, one of which aggressively said <q>walk on</q> out of the blue, and looked like a psychopath. I was listening to music with headphones on and continued walking past, ignoring them, and then she started shouting at me and insisted that I was a <q>[even worse N word]</q>. At first I thought she didn't know what that meant, but she actually did. I turned around and took my headphones out, rather than skulking off like they wanted, and the psychopath shouted at me more and then dragged the other woman away, who only shrugged and looked at me in an <q>oh well</q> sort of way and never said a word, because she understood me but was being controlled by the psychopath who was in charge and did all the talking.<br><br>I was even more stressed out by that incident, and went down the hill to some long grass, out of sight of the path, near the base of the Turquouse Bridge and lay down there, giving up on life, and looking up at the sky. After a while, I gave up lying on the grass and went over the Turquoise Bridge, onto the road round.<br><br>A little while later, an extremely savage rottweiler kept barking at me very loudly and frothing at the mouth, acting as if it desperately wanted to kill me. It caused loads of adrenaline. I thought about barking at it back, but maybe that would have aggravated it too much and it might have found a way through the fence. I walked on and thought, <q>maybe they can smell that something isn't right with my vibe today, or maybe it's always this bad but it's just more obvious today.</q><br><br>Later, I walked past the dumped fridge (which we had driven past on the previous walk earlier today).<br><br>Back at Hgwrtz, I had some sleep. I felt extreme in my head - like, <q>what am I learning today?</q> Mostly about the idea that there must be something wrong with me (due to the psychopath) (actually, I decided that the psychopath and the rottweiler were looking for a fight, and I didn't give one, maybe that's all it was).<br><br>Walk - The Hill.<br><br>TV - Narcos Season 3 Episode 10.</p>
        <p class="writing note"><br>Note: The only thing wrong with my messages to Banana-head is that there are too many of them. I also stopped on 25th of March and it was very good, so no need to worry.</p>
