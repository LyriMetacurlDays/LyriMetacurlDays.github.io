        <p class="writing note">Quote of the Day: <q>Why couldn't it go on? Couldn't our happiness go on? It's the sun that lightens up the sky. When the night gives in to tell you why</q> - Slightly modified from today's theme song, but it suits the Absolute Horror disaster.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>The Mountains</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>Sleep - about 01:30 to 05:30. Early start for mountain.<br><br>Langdale - Jack's Rake, scree slope (rock surfing on the way down).<br><br>Relaxed on the way back. The Overgod nearly went to sleep, so I had to burn him, like in Mad Max (which he appreciated). I didn't realise the lighter would work so well because he had said it doesn't work.<br><br>Back home - shower and change of clothes.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Overheaven Pub Crawl</u></h3>
        <p class="writing"><br>I went by myself.<br><br>Pub 1 - sign in compulsory, but not mask. I had half a pint of Birra Moretti. I saw a <q>live death</q> on the TV - a Danish player collapsed when they were playing Finland. Someone edited their Wikipedia page so it said <q>was</q> instead of <q>is</q>. However, later, it was found that they had been successfully resuscitated, and the Wikipedia page was back to saying <q>is</q>.<br><br>Pub 2 - Both mask and sign-in were compulsory. I had a half pint of Kronenbourg 1664.<br><br>Pub 3 - Mask was compulsory (inside but I went outside) and sign-in was not. I had two halves of Stella Artois. I invited Jace, but there was no response until after the pub crawl was over.<br><br>Pub 4 - No restrictions were enforced (so it was the best). I had two pints of Theakston's Mild. There was a group of lads trying to chat up two extremely beautiful women on the nearby bench. One of them knocked one of their drinks over (seemingly deliberately so they could buy her another one). When I got my second pint, they had left, and I asked if I could chat to them, to which they said yes. So we had a nice conversation about dinosaurs and schools (they had gone to a primary school in Hay-Town but the Common Secondary School for Overheaven, whereas I had done primary school in Overheaven and secondary school in Hay-Town). Also they were four years younger than me. Anyway, they left before I had finished my pint (on good terms) and I bade them farewell.<br><br>On the way back from the pubs, I dropped in to the Corner Shop and bought some bubblegum pop and Ace Cider, as well as some snacks and a pie (dessert)<br><br>Tea: Spaghetti bolognaise. With wine.<br><br>The Emperor visited and brought a cake. We watched the shoot-out and the hideout explosion scenes from &lsquo;Enemy of the State&rsquo; (1998) and some scenes from &lsquo;Pearl Harbour&rsquo; (2001).</p>
        <p class="writing note">Note: Today didn't get a very high rating because I was worried about the threats from the Absolute Horror over the past month, which I had tried to stop, but now I was worried that my attemps to stop them from threatening me would be evilly twisted against me, so I contacted a lawyer just in case.</p>
