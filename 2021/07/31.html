        <p class="writing note">Quote of the Day: <q>Give up your Mars. Take me to Tars.</q> - Hot Chip misheard lyrics.<br><br></p>
        <p class="writing">We had a Mega Donner from Tariq's.<br><br>Walked home and went to sleep.<br><br>I had a dream in a dream, when I woke up and I was trying to get a bee out of a stereotypical room, but it took my ushering as an attack and tried to sting me instead. Then I actually woke up and there were workers outside using some kind of buzzy device that sounded like a bee.<br><br>I listened to some music tracks I discovered yesterday and also some others by Hot Chip, including &lsquo;I Feel Better&rsquo; which has a very weird video (then again, a lot of theirs have very weird videos). By the way, searching for <q>Hot Chip</q> results mostly in reaction videos of people eating a hot crisp (since <q>chip</q> is American for crisp).<br><br>I texted Tails and met up in the Greasy Pig later on, about 11am. I waited outside 8th Headquarters. Then there was a long wait of about an hour for the breakfast (Half Paralyser) and even longer for the tea, which was superheated.<br><br>Afterwards, we decided to go to Eccup Reservoir, and DC joined us. We walked around the reservoir in the anti-clockwise way. More music themes were Shazam'd on the radio and from DC's phone on the trip.<br><br>Next, we went to the Royal Park pub and had a pint, and met up with Gold, so now there were three members of Club PM07 with DC.<br><br>I and DC picked up some samosas and onion bhajis at Abu Bakr.<br><br>We all went to the Brudenell Social Club after this and had another pint. We discussed lots of things such as life, the University and everyone in Club PM07. Yes, that's based on <q>life, the universe and everything</q>.<br><br>Tails and Gold left after that, and I and DC went to Mr Su (a new Chinese restaurant). They misheard both our orders but it wasn't that bad. I had chicken and rice noodles, and the chilli oil was very hot. The dumplings were great (with Chinese vinegar).<br><br>After this, DC dropped me off at the Student Accommodation and I rested there for a few hours.<br><br>I updated the diary, listened to music on the portable speaker, and had supper (the samosas and bhajis from earlier, which I cooked in the oven there, and the rest of the Aloe King I had bought at Mr Su).<br><br>In the last hour, I brushed my teeth and went for a proper sleep (since I wasn't drunk this time).<br><br></p>
        <p class="writing note">Note: The main thing that brought today's rating down was indigestion - it might have even been a 99 if it wasn't for that.<br><br></p>
        <p class="writing note">Note: The title is based on <q>spelling bee</q> because of the theme song &lsquo;Spell&rsquo; but there wasn't actually a spelling bee, but it was more like a <q>theming bee</q> from all the themes I found, so I gave it that title as a result.<br><br></p>
