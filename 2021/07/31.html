        <h1>Theming Bee</h1>
        <p><br></p>
        <p class="writing note">Note: The title is based on <q>spelling bee</q> because of the theme song &lsquo;Spell&rsquo; but there wasn't actually a spelling bee, but it was more like a <q>theming bee</q> from all the themes I found, so I gave it that title as a result.<br><br></p>
        <p>Date: 31st <a href="../07.html"><u>July 2021</u></a></p>
        <p>Rating: <span class="r97 nc">&nbsp;97&nbsp;</span> (Best).</p>

        <p>Music theme: Spell (Album version) (Hot Chip).<br>

        <p class="writing note">Quote of the Day: <q>Give up your Mars. Take me to Tars.</q> &mdash; Hot Chip misheard lyrics.<br><br></p>
        <p class="writing">We had a Mega Donner from Tariq's.<br><br>Walked home and went to sleep.<br><br>I had a dream in a dream, when I woke up and I was trying to get a bee out of a stereotypical room, but it took my ushering as an attack and tried to sting me instead. Then I actually woke up and there were workers outside using some kind of buzzy device that sounded like a bee.<br><br>I listened to some music tracks I discovered yesterday and also some others by Hot Chip, including &lsquo;I Feel Better&rsquo; which has a very weird video (then again, a lot of theirs have very weird videos). By the way, searching for <q>Hot Chip</q> results mostly in reaction videos of people eating a hot crisp (since <q>chip</q> is American for crisp).<br><br>I texted Tails and met up in the Greasy Pig later on, about 11am. I waited outside 8th Headquarters. Then there was a long wait of about an hour for the breakfast (Half Paralyser) and even longer for the tea to superheat.<br><br>DC joined us for a walk around Eccup Reservoir, listening to more theme tunes.<br><br>Then Gold joined us and we went to some of our old regular pubs for a couple of pints. We discussed lots of things such as life, the University and everyone in Club PM07.<br><br>Gold and Tails left after that.<br><br>I and DC went to Mr Su (a new Chinese restaurant). They misheard both our orders but it wasn't that bad. I had chicken and rice noodles, and the chilli oil was very hot. The dumplings were great (with Chinese vinegar).<br><br>After this, DC dropped me off at the Student Accommodation and I rested there for a few hours.<br><br>I updated the diary, listened to music on the portable speaker, and had supper (the samosas and bhajis from earlier, which I cooked in the oven there, and the rest of the Aloe King I had bought at Mr Su).<br><br></p>
