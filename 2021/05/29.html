        <p class="writing note">Note: Today's title is based on the newly invented term <q>Pixel Fix</q> but it couldn't be a <q>Fix</q> day because that has to be a specific date.</p>
        <p class="writing">Shower, got ready, breakfast.<br><br>10am to 12:40 - Went to the train station and took the trains to Leeds.<br><br>Checked into the hotel - I was allowed to do an early check in. The room had the same number as Commander Keen's IQ, so it was the Keen Room.<br><br>13:15 - Out with DC. We went to Red Chilli. I Shazam'd some songs, but today's theme song (the best one) couldn't be Shazam'd, so I had to ask the staff for it. At first they didn't understand, but with more asking, and some help from DC, clarifying the request and which song it was, they did successfully find the answer&#33; Which is totally awesome.<br><br>Then we tried Pixel Bar, but it was full so we had to wait till 5pm when we had our reserved seats.<br><br>In the meantime, we got some cans of lager.<br><br>There were loads of police around, due to the <q>Free Free Palestine&#33;</q> protests.<br><br>I and DC sat on the town hall steps and played some tunes. Later, we went to the bench, in the shade.<br><br>At 16:49, we headed to Pixel Bar. I played Quake 2 RTX (also, it was a different PC so I had to set up the Quake 2 Music all over again, but it was actually easier to figure out this time). We were at Pixel Bar until about 9pm, when I went back to the hotel.<br><br>Outside there was a loud night club, and it lasted all night (into tomorrow) so I expected to use the earplugs when I wanted to get to sleep.<br><br>In the meantime, I read some of <q>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F&#9608;&#9608;k</q>. I shared some of it with Cebaum, who appreciated it and said she needed it at the time.</p>
