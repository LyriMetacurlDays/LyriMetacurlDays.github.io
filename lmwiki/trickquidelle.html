<p>A very small wood in the middle of a cow field, which was supposed to be the site of a legend where a society of cave-dwelling cannibalistic Gollums would capture children and eat them, then the army blew it up. Now there is a sort of crater with some bricks in there.<br><br>It was also historically a site where the members of <a href="./evil.html">E.V.I.L.</a> would gather and discuss their evil plans.<br><br>It was named in a mocking way by the Emperor or the Viscount, who were making fun of the term &lsquo;<a href="./ziqidel.html">Ziqidel</a>&rsquo; by saying something that sounded like <q>Triquidel</q>, but they didn't define how to spell it, so Lyri invented that it had to be spelled with the most expansive way of writing it to distance it from &lsquo;Ziqidel&rsquo; which is very compact.</p>
