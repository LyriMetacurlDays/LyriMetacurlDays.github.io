        <p class="writing">I wrote <u>‘DO NOT GO HOME TUESDAY’</u>.<br><br>I got sent to bed by the Yeoman.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>Dinner: Bacon and Egg Omelette.<br><br>About 13:30, I was dropped off at the Scotch Piper (pub). I walked from there to the abbey, then the path that is between the Peacock Farm and the Scotch Piper, to the Railway Crossroad, then up the Railway part X2. I looked at my trees. Walked up the Railway part B1 (the Bridges path) up to Bridge 3, then down Railway part X1b and part W1a, then back to the Space Ship via the prime bridge over the canal (virtually straight from the end of the Railway part W1a.<br><br>The Emperor showed me a video of ‘Hey-Ya’ (OutKast) in which Hitler dances to the song:-<br>YouTube link: <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxfWhEPaWXY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxfWhEPaWXY</a></u><br><br>The Overgoddess, the Overgod and the Baroness visited and took the Princess back home.<br><br>Tea: Carrots, (wedge) chips and a chicken burger, a chicken leg, bread, sweet long red pepper and cucumber.<br><br>Supper: The last two things mentioned above, with ham and cheese butties and ‘Kettle Chips’ Crisps (Sea Salt & Distilled Malt Vinegar flavour).<br><br>The Emperor discussed various events in America. I looked them up, as well as things to do with colonisation of the Solar System, as well as the adjectives and demonyms of life forms on the various celestial bodies in the Solar System.<br><br>I read some of the chapter on fouling in the book ‘Heat Exchangers – Selection, Design and Construction’ (by E. A. D. Saunders).<br><br>Food experiments:-<br><br>1 – Having some garlic bread twirl sticks (breadsticks) and eating them in a way that provides torsion in one direction or the other. The sticks broke unpredictably, but more so in the co-torsion direction (although twisting against the twist direction was more destructive to the sticks).<br><br>2 – Squeezing a piece of sweet red long pepper. The bits went off in random directions.</p>
        <h3 class="writing"><u><br>Notes</u></h3>
        <p class="writing note"><br>* The actual date of the first successful LHC “world destroying” experiment was today, after their many setbacks. However, they must have hidden it from the general public, because I did not know about it at all, and the rest of my family also never mentioned it.<br><br>Article:-<br><u><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8593780.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8593780.stm</a></u><br><br>* Fouling (in heat exchangers) is not repeatable much – also unpredictable.<br><br>* Critical unpredictability in whether space advocacy will be successful or whether demographic changes will destroy any change of going into space. The latter possibility is a very defeatist attitude, which I would severely punish if I were in charge of things.</p>
