        <p class="writing">Today's weather&#58; A multitude of blizzards&#33;<br><br>In 7th Headquarters, I listened to today's music theme while looking at my Advent Calendar of The Stig. Then went to sleep.<br><br>I woke up and did some Advanced Mathematics. Then I walked through the snow and ice, up Spring Road, down Woodhouse Lane, and to The Building.<br><br>As promised yesterday, I decided I needed some more friends. So I walked down the stairs near the Edward Boyle Library, and voila&#33; Some people from the FoBSoc (Faculty of Biological Sciences Society) were gathered outside with some billboards, advertising their Christmas Party&#33;<br><br>After signing up for the FoBSoc and the Christmas Party, I tried to solve the Council Tax problem again, but they said they were snowed out and that I should call tomorrow.<br><br>In The Building, I was going to go to an Advanced Mathematics lecture, but Jej was also snowed out, so he couldn't lecture. I thus walked back to 7th Headquarters, and on the way I met the Black Diamond and the Spitting Image Of Paul Heaton, and walked back with them for most of the way.<br><br>A shopping visit to the co-op then ensued, in which I bought 4 packs of turkey slices and two ready meals (sausage &amp; mash).<br><br>Later that day, I went to the FoBSoc Movie Night in the museum in the lower floor of the Garstang Building. I met the FoBSoc committee of the time, which consisted of Barney, Van Helshout and the Elven Princess. The movie we watched was &lsquo;Elf&rsquo;.<br><br>After watching &lsquo;Elf&rsquo;, we went to the Old Bar. The Elven Princess put a Santa hat on my head. That became the Lucky Santa Hat, which appears in later stories.<br><br>Across the room at the Old Bar, I saw someone who I thought looked like Padda. I wondered if it was actually Padda, and I felt a strange attraction to her, like gravity.<br><br>I joined the FoBSoc crowd but kept glancing over at the woman on the table, and told the others that I feel like going up to her. They encouraged me to do it, so I went to ask her. It turned out that amazingly she had the same first real name&#33; So if I had called her by her first name straight away, I would have got it right&#33;<br><br>Everything else about her was different. She was the Elven Queen, and Padda was just a common peasant compared to the Elven Queen. She was enjoying the night out with a friend (the Elven Queen's Assistant).<br><br>After a short conversation, which flowed really nicely, I asked the Elven Queen for her Facebook name (successfully), then went back to the FoBSoc crew for the rest of the night.<br><br>On the way back, walking through Hyde Park in the Dark in the snow. I felt really good for having met the Elven Queen and I looked forward to talking to her again.<br><br>I returned to 7th Headquarters and listened to today's music theme while looking at my Advent Calendar of The Stig. So, in other words, the day ended exactly as it had begun.</p>
