        <p class="note writing">Today deserves some mention as being the fourth-best day of August 2010, and also the best day of the first half of August 2010 - the half that was not during the Summer Holiday 2010.<br><br>Also, the name of the music theme was not found until nine years, two months and twenty-one days later, which became the new record for the longest I had been searching for a music track that I eventually found. I had discovered it originally from the ScienceMagazine YouTube channel's video on the discovery of buckyballs in space, and found it later when Anton Petrov made a video claiming it was a recent discovery in 2019, so I went back to the video and it said it was in 2010, not 2019. And, this time, YouTube had tagged the music track as being called Brighten Up (Freeplay Music), but I later found on Soundcloud that the real artist is called Joey Martinez Samson.</p>

        <p class="writing">I read chapter 5 of ‘Mining the Sky’.<br><br>Sleep from about 03:00 to 15:00. I had a dream, but didn't bother recording it, and forgot it, since it was unwanted.<br><br>I got a new 3GB of data from 3 (the company) (for £15).<br><br>Dinner: French Toast.<br><br>I watched over 500 MB of the data on various videos like the end of the ‘Holographic Universe’ series some YouTube clips of ‘Zula Patrol’ (a space-themed TV program for children), the Pokémon episode ‘Electric Soldier Porygon’ (famous for being banned due to causing seizures in photosensitive epileptic people) and episode 44 of ‘YuGiOh: The Abridged Series’, as well as some videos by ScienceMagazine.<br><br>Today did go purdy quickly too, but mainly because of only getting up in the afternoon.</p>
